In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the universe.
The Most Merciful, the Most Merciful,
Master of the Day of Retribution.
It is You [Alone] whom we worship, and it is You [Alone] for whom we implore help.
Guide us to the right path,
the way of those whom You have bestowed favors on, not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.
Alif, Lâm, Mim.
This is the Book about which there is no doubt, it is a guide for the pious,
who believe in the invisible and perform Salat and spend (in obedience to Allah) from what We have allotted to them,
Those who believe in what has been sent down to you (revealed) and what has been sent down before you and who firmly believe in the Hereafter.
These are on the right path of their Lord, and they are the ones who succeed (in this life and in the life to come).
[But] certainly the infidels, whether you warn them or not, they do not believe.
Allah has sealed their hearts and ears; and a thick veil covers their sight; and for them there will be a great punishment.
Among the people there are those who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last Day!" when in fact they do not.
They seek to deceive Allah and the believers; but they deceive only themselves, and they do not realize it.
There is a sickness in their hearts, and Allah allows their sickness to grow. They will have a painful punishment for lying.
And when they are told, "Do not sow corruption on the earth," they say, "On the contrary, we are only reformers!"
Of course, they are the real corrupters, but they do not realize it.
And when they are told, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Shall we believe as the feeble-minded have believed?" Of course, they are the real weak-minded, but they don't know it.
When they meet those who have believed, they say, "We believe," but when they find themselves alone with their devils, they say, "We are with you; for we were only mocking (them)."
It is Allah Who mocks them and will harden them in their revolt and prolong their error without end.
They are the ones who have traded the right path for error. Well, their trade has not profited. And they are not on the right track.
They look like someone who has lit a fire; then when the fire illuminated all around, Allah made their light disappear and abandoned them in the darkness where they can no longer see anything.
Deaf, dumb, blind, they cannot therefore come back (from their error).
(They may also be compared to those people who,) at the moment when the clouds burst into rains, laden with darkness, thunder and lightning, put their fingers in their ears, terrified by the roar of lightning and fearing death; and Allah encircles the infidels on all sides.
The lightning almost carries away their sight: whenever it gives them light, they advance; but as soon as it is dark, they stop. If Allah willed, He would take away their hearing and sight, for Allah has power over all things.
O men! Worship your Lord, who created you and those who came before you. In this way you would attain piety.
He made you the earth for a bed, and heaven for a roof; who precipitates the rain from heaven and through it brings forth all kinds of fruit to feed you, so do not look for equals to Him, when you know (all this).
If you have any doubt about what We have revealed to Our Servant, then try to produce a similar Surah and call your witnesses, (idols) whom you worship besides Allah, if you are truthful.
If you do not succeed in this, and you certainly never will, then guard against the fire that will be fed by men and stones, which is reserved for the infidels.
Announce to those who believe and do good works that they will have gardens for their dwellings, under which the streams flow; every time they are blessed with a fruit from the garden, they will say: "This is what we were served before." Now it is something similar (only in form); there they will have pure wives, and there they will dwell forever.
Verily, Allah does not hesitate to cite as an example anything: a mosquito or anything above; as for the believers, they know well that it is the truth coming from their Lord; As for the infidels, they ask: "What did Allah mean by such an example?" By this, many are those whom He leads astray and many whom He guides; but by this He leads astray only the wicked,
who break the covenant they had firmly made with Allah, cut off what Allah has commanded to be united, and sow corruption on the earth. These are the real losers.
How can you deny Allah when He gave you life, when you were deprived of it? Then He will put you to death; then He will make you live again and finally it is to Him that you will return.
He created for you all that is on earth, and then directed His will to heaven and made it seven heavens. And He is All-Knowing.
When your Lord confided to the Angels, "I am going to set up a vicar Khalifa on earth." They said, "Are You going to appoint one to make a mess and shed blood, when we are here sanctifying You and glorifying You?" – He said, "Verily, I know what you do not know."
And He taught Adam all the names (of all things), and then He presented them to the angels and said, "Tell Me the names of these, if you are truthful." (in your claim that you are more deserving than Adam).
- They said, "Glory to You! We have no knowledge but what You have taught us. Verily, You are the All-Knowing, the Wise."
He said, "O Adam, tell them these names;" And when he had informed them of these names, Allah said: "Have I not told you that I know the mysteries of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you divulge and what you hide?"
And when We asked the angels to bow down to Adam, they prostrated themselves except for Iblis, who refused, and was puffed up with pride, and was among the infidels.
And We said, "O Adam, dwell in Paradise you and your wife, and feed on it from everywhere as you please; but do not come near this tree, or you will be among the unjust."
Soon after, Satan made them slip out of there and bring them out of the place where they were. And We said, "Come down (from Paradise); enemies of each other. And for you there will be a dwelling place on the earth, and a usufruct for a time.
Then Adam received words from his Lord, and Allah accepted his repentance, for He is indeed the Repentant, the Merciful.
- We said, "Get out of here, all of you! Whenever I send you a guide, those who follow [him] will have nothing to fear and will not be afflicted."
And those who do not believe (in our messengers) and treat Our revelations as lies, these are the people of the Fire where they will dwell forever.
O children of Israel, remember My blessing with which I have bestowed upon you. If you keep your commitments to Me, I will keep mine. And it is Me whom you must fear.
And believe in what I sent down, in confirmation of what was already with you; and don't be the first to reject it. And do not exchange My revelations for a low price. And it is Me that you must fear.
And don't mix the false with the truth. Don't knowingly hide the truth.
And perform Salah, and pay Zakat, and bow with those who bow.
Will you command people to do good, and you yourselves forget to do it, while you recite the Book? Are you, then, destitute of reason?
And seek help in endurance and salah: indeed, salah is a heavy obligation, except for the humble,
who are certain to meet their Lord (after their resurrection) and return to Him alone.
O Children of Israel, remember My blessing with which I have bestowed upon you, (remember) that I have preferred you to all the peoples (of the time).
And dread the day when no soul will suffice in any way for another; where no intercession will be accepted from her; and where no compensation will be received from it. And they will not be helped.
And [remember] when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people; who inflicted the worst punishment on you: by slaughtering your sons and sparing your wives. This was a great trial on the part of your Lord.
And [remember] when We split the sea to give you passage... So we delivered you, and drowned Pharaoh's people, while you were watching.
And when We gave Moses an appointment for forty nights... Then in his absence you took the calf as an idol while you were unrighteous (to yourselves by worshipping other than Allah).
But in spite of this, We forgave you, so that you might recognize (Our blessings on you).
And [remember] when We gave Moses the Book and the Discernment so that you might be guided.
And [remember] when Moses said to his people, "O my people, you have wronged yourselves by taking the Calf for your idol. Return therefore to your Creator; then kill the guilty yourselves: it would be better for you, with your Creator!" ... Thus He accepted your repentance; for he is indeed the Repentant and the Merciful!
And [remember] when you say, "O Moses, we will not believe you until we have seen Allah clearly"... Then lightning seized you as you looked.
Then We raised you up after your death so that you might be grateful.
And We covered you with the shadow of a cloud; and sent down manna and quail upon you: "Eat of the delights which We have allotted to you!" – It was not Us that they wronged, but they wronged themselves.
And [remember] when We said, "Enter this city, and eat there as you please; but enter through the door by prostrating yourselves and asking for the "forgiveness" (of your sins); We will forgive you your sins if you do this, and we will give more reward to the righteous.
But the wicked substituted others for these words, and to punish them for their deceit We sent them a degrading punishment from heaven.
And [remember] when Moses asked for water to quench his people's thirst, it was then that We said, "Strike the rock with your staff." And all of a sudden, twelve springs gushed out, and indeed, each tribe knew where to drink! - "Eat and drink of what Allah grants you; and do not sow trouble on the earth as troublemakers."
And [remember] when you say, "O Moses, we can't tolerate one more food. Pray therefore to your Lord that He may bring us out of the earth what it grows, from its vegetables, its cucumbers, its garlic (or wheat), its lentils and its onions!" - He replied: "Will you exchange the best for the less good? Descend to any city; you will certainly find what you ask for!" Debasement and misery fell upon them; they incurred the wrath of Allah. This is because they denied the revelations of Allah, and they killed the prophets without right. This is because they disobeyed and transgressed.
Verily, those who believed, those who became Judaized, the Nazarenes, and the Sabaeans, whoever among them believed in Allah on the Last Day and did good deeds, will be rewarded by his Lord; he will feel no fear and he will never be afflicted.
(And remember) when We made a covenant with you and held up the Mount over you, "Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what is in it, that you may be godly."
Then you turned away from it after your commitments, so if it were not for the grace of Allah and His mercy, you would certainly be among the losers.
You have certainly known those of your own who transgressed the Sabbath. Well, We said to them, "Be abject monkeys!"
We therefore made this an example to the cities that then surrounded it, and an exhortation to the pious.
(And remember) when Moses said to his people: "Verily Allah commands you to slaughter a cow." They said, "Do you take us in mockery?" "May Allah preserve me from being among the ignorant," he said.
- They said, "Ask your Lord for us to tell us what it should be." He said: "Verily Allah says that it is indeed a cow, neither old nor virgin, of middle age, between the two. Do what you are told."
- They said, "Ask your Lord for us to tell us his color." He said: "Allah says that it is a yellow cow, brightly colored and pleasant to look at."
- They said, "Ask your Lord for us to tell us what it is, for for us cows are confused. But we would certainly be well guided in this, Allah willing."
He said: "Allah says that it is a cow that has not been enslaved to plough the land or to water the field, free from infirmity and whose color is plain." - They said, "Here you are at last, you have brought us the truth." They then immolated him, but they almost did not do so.
And when you killed a man and each of you tried to exonerate yourself... But Allah unmasks what you hid.
So we said, "Strike the slain with part of the cow." - So Allah raises the dead and shows you the signs (of His power) so that you may reason
Then, and in spite of all this, your hearts became hardened; they have become like stones or even harder; for there are stones from which streams flow, others split so that water may spring up, others sink for fear of Allah. And Allah is certainly never inattentive to what you do
"Well, do you [Muslims] expect such people (the Jews) to share the faith with you?" while a group of them; after hearing and understanding the word of Allah, knowingly falsified it.
And when they meet believers, they say, "We believe," and when they are alone with each other, they say, "Will you entrust to the Muslims what Allah has revealed to you, so that you can provide them with an argument against you before your Lord? Are you then devoid of reason?"
- Do they not know that Allah knows what they hide and what they divulge?
And there are among them illiterate people who know nothing of the Book except pretensions, and they only conjecture.
Woe, therefore, to those who with their own hands compose a book and then present it as coming from Allah to make a vile profit from it. - Woe to them, then, because of what their hands have written, and woe to them because they profit by it!
And they said, "The Fire will only touch us for a few days counted." Say: "Would you have made a commitment to Allah - for Allah never breaks His commitment; "No, but you say about Allah what you do not know."
Quite the contrary! Those who do evil and who are surrounded by their sins, these are the people of the Fire where they will dwell eternally.
And those who believe and practice good deeds are the people of Paradise where they will dwell forever.
And [remember], when We made the commitment of the children of Israel to worship only Allah, to do good to fathers, mothers, close relatives, orphans and needy people, to have good words with people; to perform Salat regularly and to pay Zakat. - But with the exception of a few of you, you were breaking your commitments by turning away from Our commandments.
And remember, when We obtained from you a covenant not to shed blood for yourselves, [by murder] not to expel one another from your homes. Then you subscribed to it with your own testimony.
Although you are thus engaged, you are killing each other, expelling from their houses a part of you against whom you are lending a hand through sin and aggression. But what a contradiction! If your co-religionists come to you captive, you ransom them, even though you were forbidden to expel them. Do you then believe in one part of the Book and reject the rest? Those of you who do this deserve nothing but ignominy in this life, and on the Day of Resurrection you will be turned back to the harshest punishment, and Allah is not inattentive to what you do.
These are the ones who exchange the present life for the future life. Well, their punishment will not be lessened. And they will not be helped.
Verily, We gave the Book to Moses; We have sent after him successive prophets. And We have given proofs to Jesus, the son of Mary, and We have strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that every time a Messenger brings you truths contrary to your wishes, you are puffed up with pride? You called some impostors and you killed others.
And they said, "Our hearts are wrapped up and inscrutable" – No, but Allah has cursed them because of their unfaithfulness, so their faith is mediocre.
And when a Book came to them from Allah confirming the one they already had, whereas before they sought supremacy over the disbelievers, when it came to them that very thing which they recognized, they refused to believe it. May the curse of Allah be upon the disbelievers.
How vile is that for which they have exchanged their souls! They do not believe in what Allah has sent down, revolting at the idea that Allah, by His grace, sends down revelation on those of His servants whom He wills. So they have acquired anger upon anger, for a degrading punishment awaits the infidels!
And when it is said to them: "Believe in what Allah has sent down", they say: "We believe in what has been sent down to us". And they reject the rest, even though it is the truth confirming what was already with them. Say: "Why did you kill the Prophets of Allah before, if you were believers?"
And indeed Moses came to you with the proofs. Yet, when you were absent, you took the calf for your idol, even though you were unrighteous.
And remember, when We took the pledge of you, and brandished AT-Tûr (Mount Sinai) over you, saying, "Hold fast to what We have given you, and listen!" They said, "We have listened and disobeyed." In their impiety, their hearts were passionately in love with the Calf (the object of their worship). Say to them: "What bad prescriptions are ordained by your faith, if you are believers."
- Say: "If the Ultimate Abode with Allah is for you alone, to the exclusion of other people, then wish for [immediate] death if you are truthful."
However, they will never wish for it, knowing all the evil they have perpetrated with their hands. And Allah knows the wrongdoers well.
And certainly you will find them the most attached to the life [of this world], worse in this respect than the Associates. One of them would like to live a thousand years. But such longevity will not save him from punishment! And Allah sees their deeds well.
Say: "Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel must know that it is he who, with Allah's permission, has sent down upon your heart that revelation which declares the previous messages to be true and serves as a guide and a happy proclamation for the believers."
[Say:] "Whoever is an enemy of Allah, His angels, His messengers, Gabriel and Michael... [Allah will be his enemy] because Allah is the enemy of the infidels."
And most certainly We have sent down to you clear signs. And only perverts don't believe it.
Should every time they make a pact, some of them should denounce it? Rather, most of them are not believers.
And when a Messenger came to them from Allah confirming what was already with them, some to whom the Book had been given, threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.
And they followed what the devils say against the reign of Sulayman. Whereas Sulayman was never a disbeliever but the devils: they teach people magic and what came down to the two angels Harut and Ferut in Babylon; but they taught no one, until they first said, "We are nothing but a temptation: do not be a disbeliever," they learn from them what sows disunity between a man and his wife. However, they are not able to harm anyone except with Allah's permission. And people learn what harms them and is not profitable for them. And they know, most certainly, that whoever acquires [this power] will have no part in the Hereafter. Certainly, what a detestable commodity for which they sold their souls! If only they knew!
And if they believed and lived in piety, a reward from Allah would certainly be better. If only they knew!
O you who believe! Do not say: "Ra'inâ" (favor us) but say: "Onzurnâ" (look at us); and listen! A painful punishment will be for the infidels.
Neither the disbelievers among the People of the Book nor the Associates like to be brought down on you by your Lord, while Allah reserves His mercy for whomever He wills. And it is Allah the Possessor of abundant grace.
If We abrogate any verse or cause it to be forgotten, We bring a better one, or a similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Omnipotent?
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah you have neither protector nor helper?
Would you like to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before? Whoever substitutes disbelief for faith is indeed going astray.
Many People of the Book would like to be able to make you disbelievers out of jealousy on their part after you have believed. And after the truth has been manifested to them! Forgive and forget until Allah brings His commandment. Allah is most certainly Omnipotent!
And perform Salat and pay Zakat. And whatever is good for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, for Allah sees perfectly what you do.
And they said, "No one shall enter Paradise but Jews or Christians." These are their chimeras. - Say: "Give your proof, if you are truthful."
No, but whoever submits his being to Allah while doing good, will have his reward with his Lord. For them there is no fear, and they will not be grieved.
And the Jews say, "The Christians can't stand on anything," and the Christians say, "The Jews can't stand on anything," as they read the Book! In the same way, those who know nothing speak in a language similar to their own. Well, Allah will judge on what they oppose, on the Day of Resurrection.
Who is more unjust than the one who prevents His Name from being mentioned in the mosques of Allah, and who tries to destroy them? Such people should only enter it in fear. For them, ignominy here below; and in the Hereafter an enormous punishment.
To Allah alone belong the East and the West. Wherever you turn, the Face (direction) of Allah is there, for Allah has immense grace; He is Omniscient.
And they said, "Allah has given himself a son." Glory be to Him! No! but to Him belongs what is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him all obey.
He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothing. When He decides a thing, He just says, "Be," and it is immediately.
And those who do not know said, "Why does Allah not speak to us [directly], or why does not a sign come to us?" In the same way, those before them spoke a similar word. Their hearts are alike. We have clearly laid out the signs for people who have firm faith.
Verily, We have sent you with the truth, as a herald and a warner; and you are not asked to account for the people of Hell.
Neither Jews nor Christians will ever be satisfied with you, until you follow their religion. - Say: "Verily, it is the guidance of Allah that is the true direction." But if you follow their passions after what you have received from knowledge, you will have no protector or helper against Allah.
Those to whom We have given the Book, who recite it properly, believe in it. And those who don't believe in it are the losers.
O Children of Israel, remember My blessing with which I have bestowed upon you and favored you above the rest of the world.
And dread the day when no soul will benefit another, when no compensation will be accepted from it, and when no intercession will be of any use to it. And they will not be helped.
[And remember] when your Lord had tested Abraham by certain commandments, and fulfilled them, the Lord said to him, "I will make you an example for people to follow." "And among my descendants?" he asked. - "My commitment," says Allah, "does not apply to the unjust"
[And remember], when We made the House a place of visitation and a refuge for the people – Adopt therefore as a place of prayer, this place where Abraham stood – And We confided to Abraham and Ishmael this: "Purify My House for those who turn around it, and retreat into it, bow down and bow down there.
And when Abraham pleaded, "O my Lord, make this city a place of safety, and bestow fruit on those of its inhabitants who believe in Allah and the Last Day," the Lord said, "And whoever does not believe in it, then I will grant him a short enjoyment [in this world], and then I will compel him to the punishment of the Fire [in the Hereafter]. And what a bad destination!"
And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, "O our Lord, accept this from us! For you are the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
Our Lord! Make us Your Subjects, and our descendants a community subject to You. And show us our rites and agree to repent of it. For you are indeed the Acceptor of repentance, the Merciful.
Our Lord! Send one of their number as a messenger among them, to recite Your verses to them, to teach them the Book and Wisdom, and to purify them. For you are indeed the Mighty, the Wise!
Who, then, will have an aversion to the religion of Abraham, but he who sows his soul in foolishness? For most certainly We have chosen him in this world; and in the Hereafter he is certainly one of the good.
When his Lord had said to him, "Submit," he said, "I submit to the Lord of the universe."
And this is what Abraham recommended to his sons, as did Jacob: "O my sons, Allah has chosen religion for you: do not die, therefore, otherwise than as a submissive." (To Allah).
Were you witnesses when death came to Jacob and he said to his sons, "What will you worship after me?" - They answered, "We will worship your divinity and the divinity of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, the One Deity and to whom we are Subject."
This is a generation that is well and truly gone. To her what she has acquired, and to you what you have acquired. You will not be asked to account for what they were doing.
They said, "Be you Jews or Christians, so you will be on the right track." - Say: "No, but we follow the religion of Abraham, the very model of righteousness, and who was not among the Associates."
Say: "We believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us, and in what has been sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and in what has been given to Moses and Jesus, and what has been given to the prophets from their Lord: we make no distinction between them. And to Him we are Subject."
So, if they believe in that very thing you believe in, they will certainly be on the right track. And if they turn away from it, they will certainly be in schism! Then Allah will suffice you against them. He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
"We follow the religion of Allah! And who is better than Allah in His religion? It is He whom we worship."
Say: "Are you arguing with us about Allah, when He is our Lord and yours? Ours are our actions and yours are yours! It is to Him that we are devoted.
Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob and the tribes were Jews or Christians?" - Say: "Are you the most knowledgeable or Allah?" - Who is more unjust than the one who hides a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not inattentive to what you do.
This is a generation that is well and truly gone. To her what she has acquired, and to you what you have acquired. And you won't be asked to account for what they were doing.
The feeble-minded among the people will say: "Who has turned them away from the direction (Qibla) to which they were going before?" - Say: "To Allah belong the Rising and the Setting. He guides whomever He wills to a straight path."
And also We have made you a community of righteous people so that you may be witnesses to the people, as the Messenger will be a witness to you. And We had only established the direction (Qibla) to which you turned to know who follows the Messenger [Muhammad] and who returns on his heels. It was a difficult change, but not for those whom Allah guides. And it is not Allah who will cause you to lose your faith, for Allah is indeed Merciful and Merciful to men.
Surely we see you turning your face in all directions in the sky. So we direct you in a direction that you like. Turn your face towards the Holy Mosque. Wherever you are, turn your faces there. Verily, those to whom the Book was given know well that it is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not inattentive to what they do.
Certainly, if you were to bring all the evidence to those to whom the Book was given, they would not follow your (Qibla) direction! And you will not follow theirs; and between them, some do not follow the direction of the others. And if you were to follow their passions after what you have received from knowledge, you would certainly be among the unjust.
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their children. But some of them are hiding the truth, even though they know it!
The truth comes from your Lord. So don't be one of those who doubt.
Everyone has an orientation to which they turn. Compete therefore in good works. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all back to Himself, for Allah is indeed Omnipotent.
And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Holy Mosque. Yes, this is the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not inattentive to what you do.
And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Holy Mosque. And wherever you are, turn your faces there, so that people won't have an argument against you, except those of them who are real unrighteous. Do not fear them; but fear Me that I may complete My blessing to you, and that you may be rightly guided.
Thus, We have sent a messenger from among you who will recite Our verses to you, purify you, teach you the Book and Wisdom, and teach you what you did not know.
Remember Me then. I will reward you. Thank Me and do not be ungrateful to Me!
O you who believe! Seek help in endurance and salat. For Allah is with those who are enduring.
And do not say of those who are killed in the cause of Allah that they are dead. On the contrary, they are alive, but you are unaware of it.
Most certainly, We will test you with a little fear, hunger and diminishing goods, people and fruits. And give good news to the enduring,
who say, when a calamity befalls them: "Verily we belong to Allah, and to Him we will return.
These receive blessings from their Lord, as well as mercy; and these are the guided good.
As-Safâ and Al-Marwah are truly among the sacred places of Allah. Therefore, whoever makes Hajj to the House or does Umrah does not commit a sin by going back and forth between these two mountains. And whoever does a good deed of his own free will, then Allah is Grateful, All-Knowing.
Verily, those who hide what We have sent down as proofs and guides after We have explained it to the people in the Book, these are the ones whom Allah curses and the cursers curse,
except those who have repented, corrected and declared: from them I receive repentance. For it is I, the Acceptor of repentance, the Merciful.
Those who do not believe and die disbelievers, will receive the curse of Allah, the angels and all men.
They will remain there forever; the punishment will not be alleviated to them, nor will they be given respite.
And your Divinity is a unique divinity. There is no god but Him, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, in the alternation of night and day, in the ship that sails in the sea laden with things that benefit people, in the water that Allah sends down from heaven, by which He restores life to the earth when it is dead, and scatters beasts of all kinds in it in the variation of the winds.  and in the clouds subdued between heaven and earth, in all these there are signs for a people who reason.
Among men, there are some who, besides Allah, take equals to Him, loving them as one loves Allah. The believers are the most ardent in the love of Allah. When the wrongdoers see the punishment, they will know that all the power is Allah's and that Allah is harsh in punishment...
When the leaders disown the followers at the sight of the punishment, the bonds between them will be broken!
And the followers will say, "Ah! If a return was possible for us! Then we will disavow them as they have disowned us!" - Thus Allah showed them their deeds; a source of remorse for them; but they will not be able to come out of the Fire.
O people! Of what exists on earth; eat the lawful pure; do not follow in the footsteps of the Devil, for he is truly an open enemy to you.
He commands you only to do evil and to say against Allah what you do not know.
And when they are told, "Follow what Allah has sent down," they say, "No, but we will follow the customs of our forefathers." What if their ancestors had not reasoned and if they had not been in the right direction?
The disbelievers are like [cattle] that are shouted at and hear only a call and a voice that is confused. Deaf, dumb, blind, they do not reason.
O you who believe! Eat lawful (food) that We have given you. And thank Allah, if it is Him whom you worship.
Verily, He forbids you the flesh of a dead animal, blood, pork, and anything on which anyone other than Allah has been invoked. There is no sin on the one who is coerced without abusing or transgressing, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Those who hide what Allah has sent down from the Book and sell it at a low price, they fill their bellies only with fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection and will not purify them. And there will be a painful punishment for them.
These have exchanged right direction for error and forgiveness for punishment. What will make them endure the Fire?!
This is so, for it is with the truth that Allah sent down the Book; and those who oppose the subject of the Book are in deep divergence.
Godly kindness does not consist in turning your faces towards the Rising or the Setting. But pious kindness is to believe in Allah, in the Last Day, in the Angels, in the Book and in the Prophets, to give of one's possessions, whatever love one may have, to relatives, orphans, the needy, to needy travelers and to those who ask for help, and to loosen the yokes, to perform Salat and pay Zakat. And those who fulfill their commitments when they have enlisted, those who endure in misery, sickness and when fighting rages, these are the truthful and these are the truly pious!
O you who believe! You have been prescribed retaliation for the slain: free man for free man, slave for slave, woman for woman. But the one who is somehow forgiven by his brother must face a proper petition and must pay damages with good grace. This is a relief from your Lord, and a mercy. Therefore, whoever after this transgresses, will have a painful punishment.
It is in retaliation that you will have the preservation of life, O you endowed with understanding, so you will attain piety.
You have been prescribed, when death is near to one of you and if he leaves property, to make a will in order in favor of his father and mother and his closest relatives. This is a duty for the pious.
Whoever alters it after hearing it, sin will rest only on those who have altered it; Verily, Allah is Hearer and All-Knowing.
But whoever fears from a testator some partiality (voluntary or involuntary), and reconciles them, then there is no sin on him, for Allah is forgiving and merciful.
O you who believe! You have been prescribed aS-Siyâm as it was prescribed to those before you, so that you will attain piety,
for a set number of days. Whoever of you is sick or travelling, will have to fast an equal number of other days. But for those who could only bear it (with great difficulty), there is a compensation: feeding a poor person. And if anyone does more of his own free will, it is for himself; but it is better for you to fast; If you only knew!
(These days are) the month of Ramadan in which the Qur'an was sent down as a guide for the people, and clear evidence of good direction and discernment. So, whoever of you is present in this month, let him fast! And whoever is sick or travelling, while fasting an equal number of other days. - Allah wills ease for you, He does not want difficulty for you, so that you may complete the number and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and so that you may be grateful.
And when My servants ask you about Me. then I am very close: I respond to the call of the one who prays to Me when he prays to Me. Let them respond to My call, and believe in Me, so that they may be rightly guided.
On the night of as-Siyam you were allowed to have intercourse with your wives; they are a garment for you and you are a garment for them. Allah knows that you had clandestine relations with your wives. He has forgiven you and pardoned you. So live with them now and seek what Allah has ordained for you; eat and drink until the white thread of dawn is distinguished for you from the black thread of night. Then fast until nightfall. But don't live with them while you're on a ritual retreat in mosques. These are the laws of Allah: do not come near them. This is how Allah expounds His teachings to men, so that they may become pious.
And do not devour each other's goods illicitly; and do not use it to bribe judges to allow you to devour some of people's property, unjustly and knowingly.
They ask you about the new moons – Say: "They are used by people to count time, and also for the hajj [pilgrimage]. And it is not an act of charity to return home from the back of the houses. But godly kindness is to fear Allah. Enter the houses by their doors. And fear Allah, so that you may succeed!
Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, and do not transgress. Verily, Allah does not love transgressors.
And kill them, wherever you meet them; and drive them out of whence they have driven you: association is more serious than murder. But do not fight them near the Holy Mosque until they have fought you there. If they fight you there, kill them. This is the reward for the disbelievers.
If they cease, Allah is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
And fight them until there is no more association and the religion is entirely Allah's. If they cease, then no more hostilities, except against the unjust.
The Holy Month for the Holy Month! - The retaliation applies to all sacred things -. Therefore, whoever transgresses against you, transgress against him, with equal transgression. And fear Allah. And know that Allah is with the righteous.
And spend in the cause of Allah. And do not throw yourselves into destruction with your own hands. And do good. For Allah loves the doers.
And perform Hajj and Umrah for Allah. If you are prevented from doing so, then make a sacrifice that is easy for you. And do not shave your heads until the offering [the animal to be sacrificed] has reached its place of immolation. If any of you are sick or have a head ailment (and need to shave), then let him redeem himself with a Siyam or with alms or sacrifice. When you then find peace, whoever has enjoyed a normal life after performing Umrah while waiting for the pilgrimage, must make a sacrifice that is easy for him. If he cannot afford to fast, he should fast for three days during Hajj and seven days when he returns home, which is a total of ten days. This is prescribed for one whose family does not live near the Holy Mosque. And fear Allah. And know that Allah is harsh in punishment.
The pilgrimage takes place in known months. If one decides to perform it, then there is no sexual intercourse, no perversity, no quarrel during the pilgrimage. And the good you do, Allah knows. And take your provisions; but really the best provision is piety. And fear Me, O you endowed with understanding
It is not a sin to go in search of some grace from your Lord. Then, when you surge from 'Arafat, invoke Allah, at Al-Mash'ar-al-haram (Al-Muzdalifa). And call upon Him as He has shown you the right way, although before you were of the erring ones.
Then surge through which the people poured in, and ask Allah for forgiveness. For Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And when you have finished your rites, then call upon Allah as you invoke your fathers, and even more ardently. But there are people who only say, "Lord! Grant us [good] here below!" - For these, nowhere in the hereafter.
And there are people who say, "Lord! Grant us a fair share here below, and a good share also in the hereafter; and protect us from the punishment of the Fire!"
They will have a share of what they have acquired. And Allah is quick to give an account.
And call on Allah for a certain number of days. Secondly, there is no sin for those who behave in piety to leave after two days, to linger either. And fear Allah. And know that it is to Him that you will be gathered.
There is one among the people whose words about this life please you, and who calls Allah to witness what is in his heart, while he is the fiercest disputant.
As soon as he turns his back, he roams the land to sow disorder and ransack crops and livestock. And Allah does not like disorder!
And when he is told, "Fear Allah," criminal pride takes hold of him. Hell will suffice for him, and what a bad bed, indeed!
And there is among the people the one who sacrifices himself for the sake of Allah's pleasure. And Allah is Merciful to His servants.
O you who believe! Enter right into Islam, and do not follow in the footsteps of the devil, for he is certainly an open enemy to you.
Then, if you flinch, after the proofs have come to you, then know that Allah is Mighty and Wise.
What are they waiting for but for Allah to come to them in the shadow of the clouds and the angels and for their fate to be settled? And to Allah all things are brought back.
Ask the children of Israel how many obvious miracles We have brought them! However, whoever alters the blessing of Allah after it has come to him... so, Allah is really harsh in punishment.
The present life has been embellished with those who do not believe, and they mock those who believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah bestows His blessings on whomever He wills, without counting.
The people (originally) formed a single (believing) community. Then, (after their differences,) Allah sent prophets as heralds and warners; and He sent down with them the Book containing the truth, to settle their differences among the people. But it was the very people to whom it had been brought who began to dispute about it, after the proofs had come to them, in a spirit of rivalry. Then Allah, by His Grace, guided those who believed to this Truth about which others disputed. And Allah guides whomever He wills to the right path.
Do you think you will enter Paradise when you have not yet undergone trials similar to those that those who lived before you underwent? Misery and disease had touched them; and they were shaken until the Messenger, and with him those who had believed, cried out, "When will Allah's help come?" Surely Allah's help is at hand.
They ask you, "What should we spend?" Say: "What you spend of good should be on the father and mother, the relatives, the orphans, the poor, and the needy travelers. And whatever good you do, Allah knows it."
The fight has been prescribed to you when it is unpleasant to you. Now, it may be that you have an aversion to something that is good for you. And you may love something when it is bad for you. It is Allah who knows, while you do not know.
They ask you about waging war during the holy months. - Say: "To fight there is a grave sin, but even more grievous with Allah is to obstruct the cause of Allah, to be ungodly towards Him and the Holy Mosque, and to expel its inhabitants from there. The association is more serious than murder." Now they will not cease to fight you until, if they can, they turn you away from your religion. And those among you who renounce their religion and die infidels, their deeds in the immediate and future life will be in vain for them. These are the people of the Fire: they will dwell there forever.
Verily, those who believed, emigrated and struggled in the cause of Allah, they hope for Allah's mercy. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
They ask you about wine and gambling. Say: "In both there is a great sin and some benefits to people; but in both, sin is greater than usefulness." And they ask you, "What should we spend (on charity)?" Say: "The surplus of your possessions." Thus, Allah explains His verses to you so that you meditate
on this world and on the hereafter! And they ask you about orphans. Say: "To do good to them is the best deed. If you mix with them, then they are your brothers [in religion]. Allah distinguishes between the one who sows disorder and the one who does good. And if Allah had willed, He would have overwhelmed you. Verily, Allah is Mighty and Wise.
And do not marry women who are associators until they have faith, and certainly, a believing slave is better than a female associator, even if she delights you. And do not give wives to associates until they have faith, and surely a believing slave is better than an associate, even if he delights you. For these [the associates] invite to the Fire; while Allah invites, by His Grace, to Paradise and forgiveness And He expounds His teachings to the people so that they may remember!
- And they ask you about women's menstruation. - Say: "This is evil. Therefore keep away from women during menstruation, and do not approach them until they are pure. When they have purified themselves, then live with them according to Allah's prescriptions, for Allah loves those who repent, and He loves those who purify themselves."
Your wives are a ploughing field for you; Go to your field as you want and work for yourselves in advance. Fear Allah and know that you will meet Him. And make a gracious announcement to the believers!
And do not use the name of Allah in your oaths to excuse yourselves from doing good, from being righteous and from reconciling people. And Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
It is not for the gratuitous expressions in your oaths that Allah seizes you: He seizes you for what your hearts have acquired. And Allah is Forgiving and Patient.
For those who swear to deprive themselves of their wives, there is a four-month waiting period. And if they go back from their oath, it will be annulled, for Allah is forgiving and Merciful.
But if they decide to divorce, (it becomes enforceable), for Allah is indeed Hearing and All-Knowing.
And divorced women must observe a waiting period of three menstrual periods; and it is not permissible for them to keep quiet about what Allah has created in their bellies, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their spouses will be more entitled to take them back during this period, if they want reconciliation. As for them, they have rights equivalent to their obligations, in accordance with propriety. But men do have a predominance over them. And Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Divorce is only allowed twice. So, it's either the resumption in accordance with propriety, or the release with kindness. And it is not lawful for you to take back anything that you have given them, unless both of them are afraid that they will not be able to comply with the commands imposed by Allah. So if you fear that both of them will not be able to comply with Allah's commands, then they do not commit any sin if the woman redeems herself with any good. These are the commands of Allah. So don't transgress them. And those who transgress the commands of Allah are the unjust.
If he divorces her (the third time) then she will not be lawful for him until she marries someone else. And if the latter divorces her, then both of them do not commit any sin in resuming their life together, as long as they both think that they can comply with the commands of Allah. These are the commands of Allah, which He exposes to people who understand.
And when you divorce your wives, and their time expires, then take them back according to propriety or release them according to propriety. But do not detain them to harm them, for then you would be transgressing, and whoever does so wrongs himself. Do not mock the verses of Allah. And remember the blessing of Allah to you, and the Book and the Wisdom that He has sent down to you; by which He exhorts you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Knowing.
And when you divorce your wives, and their time expires, then do not hinder them from renewing their husbands, if they are agreeable to each other, and according to propriety. This is what the one of you who believes in Allah and the Last Day is exhorted to. This is more decent and purer for you. And Allah knows, while you do not know.
And mothers, who want to breastfeed completely, will breastfeed their babies for two full years. It is up to the father of the child to feed and clothe them in a suitable manner. No one should bear more than his means. The mother does not have to suffer damage because of her child, nor the father because of his child. The same obligation applies to the heir. And if, after consulting each other, both agree to decide on weaning, there is no grievance to be made against them. And if you want to put your children in a wet nurse, there is no grievance to be made of you either, provided that you pay the agreed remuneration, in accordance with custom. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is watching what you do.
Those of your people who die and leave wives must observe a waiting period of four months and ten days. After this period, you will not be reproached for the way in which they dispose of themselves in a proper manner. Allah is Knower of what you do.
And you will not be reproached for alluding to a proposal of marriage to women, or for keeping the intention of it secret. Allah knows that you will think of these women. But don't promise them anything secretly except to say decent words to them. And you don't decide on the marriage contract until the prescribed period has expired. And know that Allah knows what is in your souls. So beware of Him, and know also that Allah is Forgiving and Meek.
You do not commit a sin in divorcing wives whom you have not touched, and to whom you have not fixed their mahr. Give them, however, - the well-to-do according to his ability, the needy according to his ability - some suitable good which they may enjoy. It is a duty for the beneficent.
And if you divorce them without having touched them, but after their mahr has been fixed, then pay them half of what you have fixed, unless they renounce it, or the one in whose hands the marriage is to be concluded, withdraws. Withdrawal is closer to piety. And don't forget your mutual favor. For Allah sees perfectly what you are doing.
Be assiduous in the Salat and especially the Middle Salat; and stand before Allah in humility.
But if you fear (great danger), then pray while walking or on your horses. Then when you are safe, call upon Allah as He taught you what you did not know.
Those of you who die and leave wives must leave a will in favor of your wives providing for a year's maintenance without expelling them from their homes. If they are the ones who leave, then you will not be reproached for what they do that is proper for themselves. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Divorced women are entitled to the enjoyment of a suitable allowance, [constituting] a duty for the pious.
This is how Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may reason.
Have you not seen those who came out of their dwellings, of whom there were thousands, for fear of death? Then Allah said to them: "Die." After which He restored them to life. Verily, Allah is the Possessor of Favor with people; But most people are not grateful.
And fight in the cause of Allah. And know that Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
Whoever lends to Allah with good grace, He will repay him multiplied many times over. Allah restricts or extends (His favors.) And to Him you shall return.
Did you not know the history of the notables among the children of Israel, when after Moses they said to a prophet of theirs, "Appoint us a king, that we may fight in the cause of Allah?" He said, "And if you don't fight, when the fight is prescribed to you?" They said, "And what should we not fight in the cause of Allah, when we have been expelled from our homes and our children captured?" And when the battle was prescribed to them, they turned their backs, except a few of them. And Allah knows well the wrongdoers.
And their prophet said to them: "Behold, Allah has sent you Talut as king." They said, "How shall he reign over us? We have more right to royalty than he does. He has not even been lavished with much wealth!" He said: "Allah, verily, has chosen him over you, and has increased his share in knowledge and physical condition." - And Allah allocates His power to whomever He wills. Allah has immense grace and He is All-Knowing.
And their prophet said to them, "The sign of his investiture will be that the Chest will return to you; an object of tranquillity inspired by your Lord, and containing the relics of what the family of Moses and the family of Aaron left. The Angels will carry it. This is a sign for you, if you are believers!"
Then, as he was about to set out with the troops, Talut said: "Behold, Allah will test you by a river: whoever drinks from it will no longer be of mine; and whoever does not taste it will be one of mine; - is considered to be one who will draw a blow from it in the hollow of his hand." They drank it, except for a small number of them. Then when they had passed through it, he and those of the believers who accompanied him, they said, "We are powerless today against Goliath and his troops." Those who were convinced that they would have to meet Allah said: "How many times has a small army defeated a very large army by the grace of Allah! And Allah is with those who endure."
And when they confronted Goliath and his troops, they said, "Lord! Pour out endurance on us, strengthen our steps and give us victory over this infidel people."
They routed them, by the grace of Allah. And David slew Goliath; and Allah gave him kingship and wisdom, and taught him what He wanted. And if Allah did not neutralize one part of men with another, the earth would certainly be corrupted. But Allah is the Holder of Favor for the worlds.
These are the verses of Allah, which We (Muhammad) recite to you with truth. And you are, indeed, among the Messengers.
Of these messengers, We have favored some over others. There are some to whom Allah has spoken; and He has exalted others in rank. To Jesus, son of Mary, We have brought proofs, and strengthened Him with the Holy Spirit. And if Allah had willed, the people who came after them would not have killed each other after the proofs had come to them; but they were opposed: some remained believers, others were infidels. If Allah had willed, they would not have killed each other; but Allah does what He wills.
O you who believe! Spend what We have given you, before the day comes when there will be no ransom, no friendship, no intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the unjust.
Allah! There is no divinity except Him, the Living One, the Self-Subsisting One "Al-Qayyûm". Neither drowsiness nor sleep seize Him. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. Who can intercede with Him without His permission? He knows their past and their future. And of His knowledge, they embrace only what He wills. His Throne, "Kursiy", overflows the heavens and the earth, the custody of which costs Him no trouble. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.
There is no compulsion in religion! For the right path has been distinguished from error. Therefore, whoever disbelieves in the rebel while he believes in Allah grasps the strongest handle, which cannot break. And Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
Allah is the defender of those who have faith: He brings them out of darkness into light. As for those who do not believe, they have for their defenders the Tâghût, who bring them out of the light into darkness. These are the people of the Fire, where they dwell eternally.
Did you not know the story of the one who, because Allah made him king, argued against Abraham about his Lord? Abraham having said, "I have for my Lord the giver of life and death," "I also," says the other, "I give life and death." Then said Abraham, "Since Allah brings the sun from the east, then bring it from the west." The miscreant was then confounded. Allah does not guide unrighteous people.
Or like the one who passed through a deserted and devastated village: "How will Allah restore life to this one after his death?" he says. So Allah put him to death and kept him like this for a hundred years. Then He raised him up, saying, "How long have you been like this?" "I stayed a day," says the other, "or part of a day." "No," said Allah, "you have stayed a hundred years. Look at your food and drink: nothing has gone wrong; but look at your donkey... And to make you a sign to the people, and look at these bones, how We gather them together and clothe them with flesh." And when he saw the evidence, he said: "I know that Allah is Omnipotent."
And when Abraham said, "Lord! Show me how You raise the dead," Allah said, "Do you not yet believe?" "Yes," said Abraham; but let my heart be reassured." "Take, then," says Allah, "four birds, tame them (and cut them down), and then put a fragment of them on separate mountains and call them: they will come to you in all haste. And know that Allah is Mighty and wise."
Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah are like a grain from which seven ears are born, and a hundred grains the ear. For Allah multiplies the reward to whomever He wills, and the grace of Allah is immense, and He is All-Knowing.
Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah without following up their generosity with a reminder or a wrong, will have their reward with their Lord. There is no fear for them, and they will not be afflicted.
A pleasant word and forgiveness are better than alms followed by a wrong. Allah needs nothing, and He is Forgiving.
O you who believe! Do not cancel your alms with a reminder or a wrong, like one who spends his wealth ostentatiously in front of people without believing in Allah and the Last Day. He resembles a rock covered with earth: if a shower reaches him, it leaves him destitute. Such men derive no profit from their actions. And Allah does not guide people who disbelieve.
And those who spend their wealth seeking the pleasure of Allah, and well reassured (of His reward), they are like a garden on a hill. If a shower reaches it, it doubles its fruits; in the absence of a shower that reaches it, it is dew. And Allah sees perfectly what you are doing.
Would any of you like to have a garden of date palms and vines under which the streams flow, and which gives him all kinds of fruit, that old age overtakes him, while his children are still small, and that a whirlwind containing fire falls on his garden and burns it? So Allah explains the signs to you so that you may meditate.
O you who believe! Spend the best things you have earned and the crops We have brought out of the earth for you. And do not turn to what is vile to spend. Do not give what you yourself would only accept by closing your eyes! And know that Allah has no need of anything and that He is worthy of praise.
The Devil makes you fear destitution and commands you to do shameful actions; while Allah promises you forgiveness and favor from Him. Allah's grace is immense and He is All-Knowing.
He gives wisdom to whomever He wills. And he to whom wisdom is given, truly, it is an immense good that is given to him. But only those endowed with intelligence remember it.
Whatever you have spent, or what vow you have made, Allah knows. And for the unjust, there are no helpers!
If you give your alms openly, it is good; it is even better for you if you are discreet with them and give them to the needy. Allah will wipe out some of your misdeeds. Allah is Knower of what you do.
It is not for you to guide them, but it is Allah who guides whomever He wills. And whatever you spend of your possessions will be for your benefit and you spend only on seeking the "Wajh" Face of Allah. And all that you spend of your wealth in good works will be fully rewarded to you. And you will not be harmed.
To the needy who have confined themselves to the cause of Allah, not being able to travel the world, and whom the ignorant believe to be rich because they are ashamed to beg - you will know them by their appearance - they do not bother anyone by begging. And whatever you spend with your possessions, Allah knows perfectly.
Those who spend their wealth by night and by day, secretly and openly, have their wages with their Lord. They have nothing to fear, and they will not be afflicted.
Those who eat [practice] usurious interest only stand (on the Day of Judgment) as one who has been upset by Satan's touch. This is because they say, "Trade is just like interest." Whereas Allah has made trade lawful, and interest unlawful. Whoever, therefore, ceases as soon as an exhortation from his Lord has come to him, may keep what he has previously acquired; and his business depends on Allah. But anyone who does it again... so here they are, the people of Fire! They will remain there forever.
Allah destroys usurious interest and makes alms bear fruit. And Allah does not love the sinful disbeliever.
Those who have faith, have done good deeds, performed Salah and paid Zakat, will certainly have their reward with their Lord. Do not fear them, and they will not be afflicted.
O you who believe! Fear Allah; and renounce the remainder of the usurious interest, if you are believers.
And if you do not do so, then receive the news of a war from Allah and His Messenger. And if you repent, you will have your capital. You will not harm anyone, and you will not be wronged.
To the one who is in difficulty, grant a reprieve until he is well. But it's better for you to forgive the debt out of charity! If you only knew!
And fear the day when you will be brought back to Allah. Then each soul will be fully rewarded for what it has acquired. And they will not be wronged.
O you who believe! When you take out a debt with a fixed maturity, put it in writing; and let a scribe write it among yourselves in all justice; a scribe does not have to refuse to write according to what Allah has taught him; Let him write, and let the debtor dictate: Let him fear Allah his Lord, and take care not to diminish it in any way. If the debtor is wasteful or weak, or unable to dictate himself, then let his representative dictate in all justice. Have two witnesses of your men testify to it; and in the absence of two men, one man and two women from among those whom you accept as witnesses, so that if one of them goes astray, the other may call him back. And that the witnesses do not refuse when they are called. Do not tire of writing down the debt and its term, whether small or large, for it is more fair with Allah, and more upright in the testimony, and more likely to remove doubts. But if it is a present commodity that you are negotiating with each other: in that case, there is no sin in not writing it down. But take witnesses when you make a transaction between you; and let no harm be done to any scribe or witness. If you did, it would be a perversity in you. And fear Allah. Then Allah teaches you and Allah is All-Knowing.
But if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, a pledge received is enough. If there is mutual trust between you, let him to whom something has been entrusted restore it; and that he fears Allah his Lord. And do not hide the testimony: whoever hides it has a sinful heart. Allah, from what you do, is All-Knowing.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. Whether you manifest what is within you or hide it, Allah will call you to account. Then He will forgive whomever He wills, and punish whomever He wills. And Allah is Omnipotent.
The Messenger believed in what was sent down to him from his Lord, and also the believers: all believed in Allah, in His angels, in His books and in His Messengers; (saying): "We make no distinction between His messengers." And they said, "We heard and obeyed. Lord, we beg Your forgiveness. It is to You that the return will be."
Allah does not impose on any soul a burden beyond its capacity. It will be rewarded for the good it has done, punished for the evil it has done. Lord, do not chastise us if we happen to forget or make a mistake. Lord! Do not burden us with a heavy burden as You have burdened those who lived before us. Lord! Do not impose on us what we cannot bear, erase our faults, forgive us and have mercy on us. You are Our Master, grant us victory over the unfaithful peoples.
Alif, Lâm, Mîm.
Allah! There is no divinity except Him, the Living One, the Self-Subsisting One "Al-Qayyum".
He sent down the Book with the truth upon you, confirming the Books that came down before him. And He sent down the Torah and the Gospel.
before, as a guide for people. And He brought down the Discernment. Those who do not believe in the Revelations of Allah will certainly be severely punished. And Allah is Mighty, Possessor of the power to punish.
Nothing, really, is hidden from Allah from what exists on earth or in heaven.
He is the One who gives you form in the wombs as He wills. There is no god but Him, the Mighty, the Wise.
It is He who has sent down the Book upon you: there are unequivocal verses, which are the basis of the Book, and other verses that can be interpreted in different ways. Therefore, people who have an inclination towards error in their hearts emphasize the verses of ambiguity, seeking dissension by trying to find an interpretation for them, while no one knows the interpretation of them except Allah. But those who are well rooted in science say, "We believe it: it is all from our Lord." But only the intelligent remember it.
"Lord! Do not let our hearts go astray after You have guided us; and grant us Your mercy. Verily, You are the Great Giver!
Lord! It is You who will gather people together one day, in which there is no doubt, and Allah never fails to keep His promise."
Those who do not believe in their property and their children will not protect them from the punishment of Allah. They will be fuel for the Fire,
like Pharaoh's people and those who lived before them. They had treated Our proofs as lies. So Allah takes them for their sins. And Allah is harsh in punishment.
Say to those who do not believe, "You will soon be defeated; and you will be gathered to Hell. And what a bad place to rest!"
There was already a sign for you in these two troops that fought against each other: one was fighting in the cause of Allah; and the other was a disbeliever. The latter saw (the believers) with their own eyes, twice as many as themselves. And Allah helps whomever He wants with His help. This is an example for those endowed with clairvoyance!
People have been embellished with the love of the things they desire: women, children, hoarded treasures of gold and silver, marked horses, cattle and fields; all this is the object of enjoyment for this life, while it is to Allah that there is a good return.
Say, "Can I teach you anything better than all this? For the righteous, there are gardens with their Lord under which streams flow, to dwell in them forever, and also purified wives, and the pleasure of Allah." And Allah is Foreseeable upon [His] servants,
who say, "O our Lord, we have faith; therefore forgive us our sins, and protect us from the punishment of the Fire,"
they are the enduring, the truthful, the obedient, those who spend [in the cause of Allah] and those who beg forgiveness just before dawn.
Allah testifies, as do the angels and the gifted with knowledge, that there is no god but Him, the Maintainer of Justice. There is no god but Him, the Mighty, the Wise!
Certainly, the religion accepted by Allah is Islam. Those to whom the Book was brought did not quarrel, out of aggressiveness among themselves, until they had received knowledge. And whoever does not believe in the signs of Allah... then Allah is quick to call to account!
If they contradict you, say to them: "I have submitted myself and those who followed me completely to Allah." And say to those to whom the Book has been given, as well as to the illiterate: "Have you embraced Islam?" If they embrace Islam, they will be well guided. But; if they turn their backs... Your duty is only the transmission (of the message). Allah, upon [His] servants, is Clairvoyant.
Those who do not believe in the signs of Allah, kill the prophets without right, and kill those who command justice, announce to them a painful punishment.
It is they whose works have become in vain, here below as well as in the hereafter. And for them, there are no rescuers!
Have you not seen how those who have received a portion of the Book act, and who are now invited to the Book of Allah to settle their differences; How does a group of their own turn their backs and slip away?
That's because they say, "The Fire will only touch us for a certain number of days." And their lies deceive them in religion.
Well, how will they be, when We have gathered them together, in a day about which there is no doubt, and each soul will be fully rewarded according to what it has acquired? And they will not be wronged.
- Say: "O Allah, Master of absolute authority. You give authority to whomever You will, and You snatch authority from whomever You will; and You give power to whomever You will, and You humble whomever You will. Good is in Your hand and You are Omnipotent.
You bring night into day, and You bring day into night, and You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living. And You give attribution to whomever You will, without counting."
Let not believers take infidels as allies, instead of believers. Whoever does so contradicts the religion of Allah, unless you seek to protect yourself from them. Allah warns you about Himself. And it is to Allah that he returns.
Say: "Whether you hide what is in your breasts or divulge it, Allah knows. He knows all that is in heaven and on earth. And Allah is Omnipotent.
The day when each soul will find itself confronted with what it has done well and what it has done badly; she will wish that there was a long distance between her and this evil! Allah warns you about Himself. Allah is Merciful to [His] servants.
Say: "If you truly love Allah, follow me, then Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Say: "Obey Allah and the Messenger. And if you turn your back... then Allah does not love infidels!
Verily, Allah has chosen Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham and the family of Imran above all others.
As descendants of one another, and Allah is Hearer and All-Knowing.
(Remember) when 'Imran's wife said, "Lord, I have dedicated to You exclusively what is in my womb. Accept it, then, from me. You are indeed the Hearer and the All-Knowing.
Then when she had given birth to it, she said: "Lord, behold, I have given birth to a girl," and Allah knew best what she had given birth to. The boy is not like the girl. "I have named her Mary, and I place her and her descendants under Your protection from the Devil, the banished."
His Lord then accepted it with good pleasure, and made it grow in good growth. And He entrusted the custody of it to Zechariah. Whenever he entered the Sanctuary with her, he found food near her. He said, "O Mary, where does this food come from?" – She said, "It comes to me from Allah." He certainly gives food to whomever He wills without counting.
Then Zechariah prayed to his Lord, and said, "O my Lord, give me an excellent offspring from You. For You are the One who hears prayer well."
Then the angels called to him while he was standing and praying in the Sanctuary: "Behold, Allah announces to you the birth of Yahya, the confirmation of a word of Allah. He will be a ruler, a chaste, a prophet and one of the good."
He said, "O my Lord, how can I have a boy now that old age has overtaken me and my wife is barren?" Allah says: "Like this!", Allah does what He wills.
- "Lord," said Zechariah, "give me a sign." - "Your sign," says Allah, "is that for three days you will be able to speak to people only by gesture. Call upon your Lord a lot; and glorify Him at the end and beginning of the day."
(Remember) when the angels said: "O Mary, Allah has chosen and purified you; and He has chosen you above the women of the worlds.
"O Mary, obey your Lord, prostrate yourself, and bow down with those who bow."
- These are the news of the Unknowable that We reveal to you. For you were not there when they threw away their calames to decide who should take care of Mary! You weren't there when they were arguing either!
(Remember) when the angels said: "O Mary, behold, Allah announces to you a word from Him: her name will be "Al-Masîh", "'Issa", son of Mary, illustrious in this world and in the Hereafter, and one of the near of Allah".
He will speak to the people, in the cradle and in his middle age, and he will be among the good."
- She said, "Lord! How could I have a child, when no man touched me?" – "That's the way it is!" He said. Allah creates what He wills. When He decides on something, He only says to her, "Be," and she is at once.
And (Allah) will teach him scripture, wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel,
and He will be the messenger to the children of Israel, [and will say to them]: "Verily, I come to you with a sign from your Lord. For you, I form clay like the figure of a bird, and then I blow into it: and, by Allah's permission, it becomes a bird. And I heal the man born blind and the leper, and I raise the dead, by the permission of Allah. And I teach you what you eat and what you store up in your homes. This is a sign for you, if you are believers!
And I confirm what is in the Torah revealed before me, and I make lawful for you a part of what was forbidden to you. And I have certainly brought a sign from your Lord. Fear Allah, then, and obey me.
Allah is my Lord and your Lord. Worship Him, then, and this is the straight way."
Then, when Jesus felt unbelief from them, he said, "Who are my allies in the way of Allah?" The apostles said, "We are the allies of Allah. We believe in Allah. And be a witness that we are subject to him.
Lord! We believed that You sent down and followed the messenger. So register us among those who testify."
And they [the others] began to plot. Allah has thwarted their plot. And Allah knows best how to plot them!
(Remember) when Allah says: "O Jesus, verily, I will put an end to your earthly life, raise you to Me, rid you of those who did not believe, and put those who follow you above those who do not believe until the Day of Resurrection. Then you will return to Me, and I will judge between you what you were opposing on.
As for those who have not believed, I will punish them with a severe punishment, both here and hereafter; And for them, there are no rescuers.
And as for those who have faith and do good works, He will give them their rewards. And Allah does not love the unjust.
This is what We recite to you from the verses and from the precise revelation.
To Allah, Jesus is like Adam, whom He created from dust, and then He said to him, "Be," and He was.
The truth comes from your Lord. Do not be among the sceptics.
To those who contradict you about him, now that you are well informed, you have only to say: "Come, let us call our sons and yours, our wives and yours, our own persons and yours, and then let us utter mutual execration by calling down Allah's curse on liars.
This, of course, is the true story. And there is no god but Allah. Verily, it is Allah who is the Mighty, the Wise.
So if they turn their backs... then Allah knows well the sowers of corruption!
Say: "O People of the Book, come to a common word between us and you: that we worship only Allah, without associating anything with Him, and that we do not take one another as lords besides Allah." Then, if they turn their backs, say, "Be witnesses that we are submissive."
O People of the Book, why do you dispute about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel came down only after him? Are you not reasoning, then?
You have indeed argued about something you know. But why do you argue about things you don't know about? But Allah knows, but you do not know.
Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian. He was completely subject to Allah (Muslim). And he was not one of the Associates.
Certainly the men most worthy to claim Abraham are those who followed him, as well as this Prophet, and those who have faith. And Allah is the ally of the believers.
Some of the People of the Book would have liked to lead you astray. But they only lead astray; and they are not aware of it.
O People of the Book, why do you not believe in the verses of Allah (the Qur'an), while you are witnesses of them?
O People of the Book, why do you mix the false with the true and knowingly hide the truth?
Thus says some of the People of the Book: "At the beginning of the day, believe in what has been revealed to the Muslims, but at the end of the day, reject it, so that they may return (to their old religion).
[And the People of the Book say to their co-religionists]: "Believe only those who follow your religion..." Say: "The true direction is the guidance of Allah" – [and they also say: You must neither approve nor acknowledge] that anyone other than you can receive as what you have received so that they (the Muslims) cannot argue against you to your Lord. Say to them: Verily, grace is in the hand of Allah. He gives it to whomever He wills. Allah's grace is immense and He is All-Knowing.
He reserves his mercy for whomever He wills. And Allah is the Possessor of immense grace.
And among the People of the Book there are some who, if you entrust him with a qintar, give it back to you. But there are also some who, if you entrust him with a dinâr, will not repay you unless you force him to do so unceasingly. All this because they say: "These (Arabs) who don't have a book have no way to coerce us." They tell lies against Allah when they know.
On the contrary, whoever fulfills his promise and fears Allah... Allah loves the pious.
Those who sell their pledge to Allah and their oaths at a low price will have no part in the Hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them or look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them. and they will have a painful punishment.
And there are some among them who roll their tongues as they read the Book to make you believe that it comes from the Book, when it is not from the Book; and they say: "This is from Allah, but it is not from Allah. They knowingly tell lies against Allah.
It would not be fitting for a human being to whom Allah has given the Book, the Understanding and the Prophethood, to then say to the people: "Be my worshippers, to the exclusion of Allah; but on the contrary, [he must say]: "Become learned, obedient to the Lord, since you teach the Book and study it."
And he is not going to command you to take angels and prophets as your lords. Would he command you to reject the faith, you who are Muslims?
And when Allah made this commitment from the prophets: "Whenever I grant you a Book and wisdom, and then a messenger comes to you to confirm what is with you, you must believe in him, and you must help him." He said to them, "Do you consent and accept My covenant on this condition?" - "We consent," they said. "Be witnesses, then," says Allah. And here I am, with you, among the witnesses.
Whoever will then turn his back... then they are the ones who will be the perverts."
Do they desire a religion other than that of Allah, when all that is in the heavens and on earth is subject to Him, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned?
Say: "We believe in Allah, in what was sent down upon us, in what was sent down on Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the tribes, and in what was brought to Moses, Jesus and the prophets from their Lord: we make no difference between them; and it is to Him that we are Subject."
And whoever desires a religion other than Islam will not be accepted, and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter.
How would Allah guide people who no longer have faith after they believe and testify that the Messenger is truthful, and after the proofs have come to them? Allah does not guide unrighteous people.
Their reward will be that they will have the curse of Allah, the Angels and all human beings upon them.
They will remain there forever. The punishment will not be alleviated for them, and they will have no respite,
except those who will later repent and reform: for Allah is forgiving and merciful.
Verily, those who no longer believe after having faith, and allow their disbelief to increase even more, their repentance will never be accepted. These are really the misguided ones.
Those who do not believe and die disbelievers, it will never be acceptable for any of them to redeem themselves, even if they give the golden content of the earth. They will have a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers.
You will only attain (true) piety if you make largesse of what you cherish. Whatever you do with largesse, Allah certainly knows well.
All food was lawful for the children of Israel, except that which Israel itself forbade itself before the Torah came down. Say [them]: "Bring the Torah and read it, if what you say is true."
So, whoever after that invents lies against Allah... these are, therefore, the truly unjust.
Say: "It is Allah who speaks the truth. So follow the religion of Abraham, an upright Muslim. And there were no associates."
The first House that was built for the people was that of Bakka (Mecca) blessed and a good direction for the universe.
There are clear signs, among them the place where Abraham stood; and whoever enters it is safe. And it is a duty to Allah for people who have the means to go and make the pilgrimage of the House. And whoever doesn't believe... Allah largely dispenses with worlds.
Say: "O People of the Book, why do you not believe in the verses of Allah (al-Qur'an), while Allah is witness of what you do?"
Say: "O People of the Book, why do you obstruct the way of Allah to the one who has faith, and why do you want to make this way crooked, when you are witnesses of the truth?" And Allah is not inattentive to what you do.
O you who believe! If you obey a group of those who have been given the Book, it will make you disbelievers after you have faith.
And how can you not believe, when the verses of Allah are recited to you, and His Messenger stands in your midst? Whoever is strongly attached to Allah, he is guided to a straight path.
O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared. And die only in full submission.
And cling all together to Allah's "Habl" (cable) and do not be divided; and remember the blessing of Allah upon you: when you were enemies, it was He who reconciled your hearts. Then, by His blessing, you became brothers. And when you were on the brink of an abyss of Fire, it was He who saved you from it. So Allah shows you His signs so that you may be rightly guided.
Let there be from you a community that calls for the good, commands what is proper, and forbids what is blameworthy. Because they will be the ones who will succeed.
And don't be like those who divided and began to argue, after the proofs came to them, and they will have a great punishment.
On the day when some faces will light up, and others will darken. To those whose faces are darkened (it will be said): "Did you disbelieve after you had faith?" Now, taste the chastisement, for denying the faith.
And as for those whose faces are brightened, they will be in the mercy of Allah, where they will dwell forever.
These are the verses of Allah; We recite them to you (Muhammad) with truth. And Allah does not want to harm the worlds.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. And to Allah all things will be brought back.
You are the best community that has been raised up for men. You command what is proper, forbid what is blameworthy, and believe in Allah. If the People of the Book believed, it would be better for them, there are some who have faith, but most of them are perverts.
They will never know how to cause you great harm, only a nuisance (through the tongue); and if they fight you, they will turn their backs on you, and then they will have no help.
Wherever they are, they are degraded, unless there is a providential help from Allah or a pact made with men. They have incurred the wrath of Allah, and now they have been struck with misfortune, for not believing in the signs of Allah, and for unjustly murdering the prophets, and also for disobeying and transgressing.
But they are not all the same. There is an upright community among the People of the Book who, in the hours of the night, recite the verses of Allah while prostrating themselves.
They believe in Allah and the Last Day, command what is proper, forbid what is blameworthy, and contribute to good deeds. These are among the good people.
And whatever good they do, it will not be denied to them. For Allah knows the righteous well.
As for those who do not believe, neither their property nor their children will ever be able to serve them against the punishment of Allah. And they are the people of the Fire: they will dwell there forever.
What they spend in this life is like an icy wind that beats down on a field belonging to people who have wronged themselves, and destroys it. For it is not Allah who causes them harm, but they harm themselves.
O believers, do not take confidants outside of yourselves: they will not fail to upset you. They would like you to be in trouble. Hatred has certainly manifested itself in their mouths, but what their breasts hide is even more enormous. Here We are exposing the signs to you. If you could reason!
You (Muslims) love them, but they do not love you; and you have faith in the whole Book. And when they meet you, they say, "We believe," and when they are alone, in rage with you, they bite each other's fingertips. Say: "Die of your rage." Verily, Allah knows the contents of hearts very well.
If a good touches you, they grieve for it. If an evil befalls you, they rejoice. But if you are enduring and pious, their scheming will not cause you any harm. Allah knows perfectly well everything they do.
When one morning you (Muhammad) left your family to assign the fighting posts to the believers, and Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
When two of your groups thought of giving way! While Allah is the ally of both of them! For it is in Allah that the believers must place their trust.
Allah gave you victory in Badr when you were humiliated. Fear Allah, then. So that you can be grateful!
(Allah has given you victory) when you said to the believers; "Is it not enough for you that your Lord sends down three thousand angels for help?"
Of course! If you are enduring and pious, and they [the enemies] immediately assail you, your Lord will send you five thousand distinctly marked angels as reinforcements.
And Allah did it only (to tell you) good news, and to make sure of it in your hearts. Victory can only come from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise;
to annihilate some of the disbelievers or to humiliate them (by defeat) and so that they return disappointed.
- You (Muhammad) have no part in the (divine) order - let Him (Allah) accept their repentance (by embracing Islam) or chastise them, for they are indeed unjust.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and He chastises whom He wills... And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who believe! Don't practice usury by multiplying your capital disproportionately. And fear Allah so that you may succeed!
And fear the Fire prepared for the disbelievers.
And obey Allah and the Messenger so that mercy may be shown to you.
And work together for the forgiveness of your Lord, and for a Garden (paradise) as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the righteous,
who spend in ease and in adversity, who overcome their rage and forgive others - for Allah loves the do-good -
and for those who, if they have committed any deceit or caused any harm to their own souls (by disobeying Allah), remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins - and who forgives sins if not Allah? - and who do not knowingly persist in the evil they have done.
These are rewarded with the forgiveness of their Lord, as well as the Gardens under which the streams flow, to dwell there forever. How beautiful is the wages of those who do good!
Before you, of course, many events have happened. Now go through the earth, and see what has become of those who called (the prophets) liars.
This is a talk for people, a guide, and an exhortation for the righteous.
Don't let yourselves be beaten, don't grieve when you're the superiors, if you're true believers.
If a wound strikes you, such a wound also strikes the enemy. So We make the days (good and bad) alternate among the people, so that Allah may recognize those who believe, and choose martyrs from among you, and Allah does not love the wrongdoers.
and that Allah may purify those who believe, and annihilate the disbelievers.
Do you intend to enter Paradise without Allah distinguishing among you those who struggle and endure?
Of course, you wished for death before you met her. But you saw it, indeed, while you were looking!
Muhammad is only a messenger - messengers before him have passed. If he died, then, or if he was killed, would you go back on your heels? Whoever returns on his heels will not harm Allah in any way; and Allah will soon reward those who are grateful.
No one can die except by Allah's permission, and at a predetermined time. Whoever wants the reward of this world, We give it to him. Whoever wants the reward of the Hereafter, We give it to him, and We will soon reward the grateful.
How many prophets fought, along with many disciples, they did not relent because of what happened to them in the cause of Allah. They did not weaken and they did not yield. And Allah loves those who endure.
And they had only this word: "Lord, forgive us our sins and our excesses in our behavior, strengthen our steps and give us victory over the disbelievers."
Allah, therefore, gave them the reward of this world, as well as the beautiful reward of the Hereafter. And Allah loves good people.
O you who believe! If you obey those who do not believe, they will turn you back. And you will come back as losers.
But Allah is your Master. He is the best rescuer.
We are going to strike fear into the hearts of the disbelievers. For they have associated with Allah (idols) without any proof coming down from Him. Fire will be their refuge. What a bad abode is that of the unjust!
And verily, Allah kept His promise to you, when by His permission you killed them unceasingly, until the moment when you relented, when you argued about the order given, and you disobeyed after He had shown you (the victory) that you love! There were some among you who desired the life of this world, and there were some among you who desired the hereafter. Then He made you recoil before them, in order to test you. And certainly He has forgiven you. And Allah is the Possessor of grace towards the believers.
(Remember) when you fled without looking back at anyone, while behind you the Messenger was calling you. Then He inflicted anguish upon anguish upon you, so that you would not be grieved for what has escaped you or for the setbacks you have suffered. And Allah is Fully Aware of what you do.
Then He sent down upon you, after anguish and tranquillity, a sleep that enveloped some of you, while another part was anxious for itself and had thoughts about Allah that were not in accordance with the truth, thoughts worthy of the age of Ignorance. - They said, "Do we have any part in this matter?" Say: "The whole matter is Allah's." What they do not reveal to you, they hide within themselves: "If we had had any choice in this matter," they say, "We would not have been killed here." Say: "Had you been in your houses, those for whom death was decreed would have gone out to the place where death awaited them. This is so that Allah may test what you have in your breasts, and purify what you have in your hearts. And Allah knows what is in the hearts.
Those of you who turned your backs on the day the two armies met, it was only the Devil who made them flinch, because of some of their (evil) deeds. But Allah has forgiven them. For truly Allah is Forgiving and Forgiving!
O you who believe! Do not be like those disbelievers who said of their brothers who went on a journey or to fight, "If they were with us, they would not have died, and they would not have been killed." Allah made it a cause of regret in their hearts. It is Allah who gives life and death. And Allah is watching what you do.
And if you are killed in the cause of Allah or die, forgiveness from Allah and mercy are better than what they gather.
Whether you die or are killed, you will be gathered to Allah.
It is by some mercy from Allah that you (Muhammad) have been so kind to them! But if you were rough, hard-hearted, they would have run away from you. Forgive them, therefore, and beg forgiveness for them. And consult them about affairs; then once you have made up your mind, entrust yourself to Allah, Allah truly loves those who trust in Him.
If Allah gives you His help, no one can defeat you. If He abandons you, who will help you after Him? It is Allah that believers must trust.
A prophet is not someone who appropriates booty. Whoever appropriates it, will come with what he has appropriated on the Day of Resurrection. Then, to each individual what he has acquired will be fully rewarded. And they will not be wronged.
Is the one who obeys Allah's pleasure the same as the one who incurs the wrath of Allah? His refuge will be Hell; and what a bad destination!
They have different degrees with Allah, and Allah observes what they do.
Allah has certainly done a favor to the believers when He has sent a messenger from among them to them, who will recite His verses to them, purify them, and teach them the Book and the Wisdom, even though they were already in an obvious error.
What! When a misfortune befalls you, but you once inflicted twice as much, you say, "Where does this come from?" Answer them: "It comes from yourselves." Verily, Allah is Omnipotent.
And all that you suffered on the day when the two troops met, it was by Allah's permission, and in order that He might distinguish the believers,
and that He distinguishes hypocrites. They were told, "Come and fight in the cause of Allah, or repel [the enemy]," and they said, "Of course we would follow you if we were sure that there would be a war." On that day, they were closer to disbelief than to faith. They said with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And Allah knows very well what they hid.
Those who remained in their homes said to their brothers, "If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed." Say: "Therefore remove death from you, if you are truthful."
Do not think that those who were killed in the cause of Allah are dead. On the contrary, they are alive, with their Lord, well provided for
and rejoicing in the favor that Allah has bestowed upon them, and delighted that those who have remained behind them and have not yet joined them, will know no fear and will not be afflicted.
They are delighted with a blessing from Allah and a favor, and with the fact that Allah does not let the reward of the believers go to waste.
Those who, although wounded, responded to the call of Allah and the Messenger, there will be a great reward for those among them who have done good and practiced piety.
Certainly those to whom it was said, "The people have gathered against you; fear them" - this increased their faith - and they said: "Allah is sufficient for us; He is our best guarantor."
So they returned with a blessing from Allah and a grace. No evil came to them, and they followed what pleases Allah. And Allah is the Possessor of immense grace.
It is the Devil who frightens you of his adherents. So don't be afraid of them. But be afraid of Me, if you are believers.
Do not (O Muhammad) have any sorrow for those who quickly throw themselves into disbelief. Verily, they will not harm Allah in any way. Allah is anxious not to assign to them any share of property in the Hereafter. And for them there will be a huge punishment.
Those who have exchanged belief for disbelief will not harm Allah in any way. And for them a painful punishment.
Let not those who have not believed count on the delay which We grant them to their advantage. If We grant them a delay, it is only so that they may increase their sins. And for them a degrading punishment.
Allah is not such that He leaves the believers in the state you are in until He distinguishes the bad from the good. And Allah is not such that He reveals to you the Unknowable. But Allah chooses from among His Messengers whom He wills. Therefore believe in Allah and His Messengers. And if you have faith and godliness, then you will have a tremendous reward.
Let not those who greedily guard what Allah gives them by His grace count it as good for them. On the contrary, it is bad for them: on the Day of Resurrection, what they have kept with greed will be tied around their necks. It is Allah who has the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Fully Aware of what you do.
Allah has certainly heard the words of those who said: "Allah is poor and we are rich." We record their words, as well as their murder, without right, of the prophets. And We will say to them: "Taste the punishment of the furnace.
This is because of what your hands have done." For Allah does not harm the servants.
The same ones who said: "Truly Allah has enjoined us not to believe in a Messenger until He has brought us an offering that the fire consumes." - Say: "Messengers before me have come to you with proofs, and with what you have said. Why did you kill them, if you are truthful?"
If they (Muhammad) call you a liar, the prophets before you have certainly been called liars. They had come with the clear proofs, the Psalms and the Luminous Book.
Every soul will taste death. But it is only on the Day of Resurrection that you will receive your full reward. Whoever is removed from the Fire and brought into Paradise has certainly succeeded. And the present life is only an object of deceptive enjoyment.
Certainly you will be tried in your goods and your persons; and certainly you will hear many unpleasant words from those to whom the Book was given before you, and from the Associates. But if you are enduring and pious... this is the best resolution to take.
Allah took this commitment from those to whom the Book was given: "Expose it to the people and do not hide it." But they threw it behind their backs and sold it at a low price. What a bad trade they have made!
Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who like to be praised for what they have not done, do not think, then, that they find an escape from punishment. For them, there will be a painful punishment!
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Omnipotent.
Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for the endowed with understanding,
who, standing, sitting, lying on their sides, call upon Allah and meditate on the creation of the heavens and the earth (saying): "Our Lord! You did not create this in vain. Glory to You! Keep us from the punishment of the Fire.
Lord! Whoever You bring into the Fire, You truly cover him with disgrace. And for the unjust, there are no helpers!
Lord! We have heard the call of the one who called to faith: "Believe in your Lord" and from then on we have believed. Lord, forgive us our sins, blot out our misdeeds, and place us with the good people when we die.
Lord! Give us what You have promised us through Your messengers. And do not cover us with shame on the Day of Resurrection. For You do not fail in Your promise."
Their Lord then heard them (saying, "Verily, I do not let the good that any of you has done, male or female, go to waste, for you are one from one another. Therefore, those who have emigrated, who have been expelled from their homes, who have been persecuted in My way, who have fought, who have been killed, I will indeed consider their evil deeds to be expiated, and will bring them into the Gardens under which the streams flow, as a reward from Allah." As for Allah, it is with Him that the greatest reward is.
Let not be deceived by the versatility of those who are unfaithful in the land.
Poor enjoyment! Then their refuge will be Hell. And what a detestable layer!
But those who fear their Lord will have gardens under which streams flow, to dwell there forever, a place of welcome from Allah. And what is with Allah is better for the righteous.
There are certainly among the People of the Book those who believe in Allah and in what has been sent down to you and what has been sent down to them. They are humble to Allah, and do not sell the verses of Allah at a low price. These are the ones whose reward is with their Lord. Verily, Allah is quick to make the accounts.
O you who believe! Be enduring. Encourage endurance. Constantly fight (against the enemy) and fear Allah, so that you may succeed!
O men! Fear your Lord, who created you from one being, and from him his bride, and from these two caused many men and women to be scattered. Fear Allah, in whose name you implore one another, and fear breaking the ties of blood. Verily, Allah is watching you perfectly.
And give the orphans their goods; do not substitute the bad for the good. Do not eat their goods with yours: it is really a great sin.
And if you are afraid of not being fair to orphans,... It is lawful to marry two, three, or four of the women you like, but if you fear that you will not be fair to them, then only one, or slaves that you own. This is in order not to do injustice (or so as not to aggravate your family burden).
And give the wives their mahr, with good grace. If they willingly give up something of it to you, then dispose of it at your ease and with a good heart.
And do not entrust to the incompetent your possessions, which Allah has made your sustenance. But take from them food and clothing; and speak to them properly.
And test (the ability) of the orphans until they attain (the suitability) for marriage; and if you feel that they are doing well, give them their possessions. Do not use them (for your own sake) with waste and dissipation, before they grow. Whoever is well-to-do, let him abstain from taking it himself. If he is poor, then let him use them sensibly: and when you hand over their property, take witnesses against them. But Allah is enough to observe and count.
Men are responsible for a part of what their father and mother and relatives have left; and to women a share of what the father and mother as well as the relatives have left, whether little or a lot: a fixed part.
And when the next of kin, the orphans, the needy attend the division, offer them something of the inheritance, and speak to them properly.
Let fear seize those who leave behind them a weak descendant, and who are anxious about them; therefore let them fear Allah and speak righteous words.
Those who eat [dispose] unjustly of the goods of orphans only eat fire in their bellies. They will soon burn in the flames of Hell.
This is what Allah commands you to do with regard to your children: to the son, a share equal to that of two daughters. If there are only girls, even more than two, then two-thirds of what the deceased leaves. And if there is only one, then half of it. As for the father and mother of the deceased, to each of them the sixth of what he leaves, if he has a child. If he has no children and his father and mother inherit from him, then his mother will receive one-third. But if he has brothers, then to the mother the sixth, after execution of the will he has made or payment of a debt. Of your ascendants or descendants, you do not know who is closer to you in use. This is an obligatory command of Allah, for Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And to you half of what your wives leave, if they have no children. If they have a child, then to you a quarter of what they leave, after the execution of the will they would have made or the payment of a debt. And to them a quarter of what you leave, if you don't have children. But if you have a child, then to them the eighth of what you leave after the execution of the will you would have made or the payment of a debt. And if a man or a woman dies without a direct heir, yet let him leave a brother or sister, to each of these then a sixth. If there are more than two, then all of them will participate in the third party, after execution of the will or payment of a debt, without prejudice to anyone. (Such is the) Injunction of Allah! And Allah is All-Knowing and Forgiving.
These are the commands of Allah. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will bring him into the Gardens under which the streams flow, to dwell there forever. And that's the great success.
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His commands, He will bring him into the Fire to dwell there forever. And he will have a degrading punishment.
Those of your wives who fornicate, have four of you testify against them. If they testify, then confine these women to your homes until death calls them back or Allah decrees another order for them.
The two of you who have committed it, punish them. If they then repent and reform, then leave them in peace. Allah remains Welcoming to repentance and Merciful.
Allah only welcomes the repentance of those who do evil out of ignorance and immediately repent. These are the ones from whom Allah welcomes repentance. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
But absolution is not for those who do evil deeds until death comes to one of them, and he cries out, "Verily, I repent now," nor for those who die disbelievers. And it is for them that We have prepared a painful punishment.
O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will. Don't prevent them from remarrying in order to take away some of what you gave from them, unless they commit a proven sin. And behave properly towards them. If you have an aversion to them during your life together, you may have an aversion to something in which Allah has deposited a great good.
If you want to substitute one wife for another, and you have given one a qintar, do not take anything back. What! Would you rebuke him out of injustice and manifest sin?
How can you dare to take it up again, after the most intimate union has associated you with each other, and they have obtained a solemn engagement from you?
And do not marry the women whom your fathers married, except for the past. It is a turpitude, an abomination, and what bad conduct!
You are forbidden your mothers, daughters, sisters, paternal aunts and maternal aunts, daughters of a brother and daughters of a sister, mothers who have nursed you, foster-sisters, mothers of your wives, daughters-in-law under your guardianship and descendants of women with whom you have consummated marriage; if the marriage has not been consummated, this is not a sin on your part; the wives of your sons born of your loins; as well as two sisters together - except for the past. For truly Allah is Forgiving and Merciful;
and, among the women, the ladies (who have a husband), unless they are your slaves in full ownership. Allah's prescription upon you! Apart from that, it is permissible for you to seek them out, using your possessions and entering into marriage, not as debauched. Then, as you enjoy them, give them their mahr as a thing due. There is no sin against you if you make any agreement among yourselves after the mahr has been set, for Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And whoever among you does not have the means to marry free (non-slave) believing women, well (he can marry) a woman among those of your believing slaves. Allah knows your faith best, for you are one of the same religion. And marry them with the permission of their masters (Waliy) and give them a suitable mahr; (marry them) being virtuous and not given over to debauchery or having clandestine lovers. If, once engaged in marriage, they commit adultery, they receive half the punishment due to free (non-slave) married women. This is permissible to those of you who fear debauchery; but it would be better for you to be enduring. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Allah wants to enlighten you, to show you the ways of men before you, and also to welcome your repentance. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And Allah wants to welcome your repentance. But those who follow the passions want you to bow greatly (to error as they do).
Allah wants to lighten your obligations because man was created weak.
O you who believe! Let none of you eat each other's goods illegally. But let there be (legal) trade, between you, by mutual consent. And don't kill yourself. Allah, verily, is merciful to you.
And whoever does this because of excess and iniquity, We will throw him into the Fire, which is easy for Allah.
If you avoid the great sins that are forbidden to you, We will erase your misdeeds from your account, and We will bring you into an honorable place (Paradise).
Do not covet what Allah has bestowed upon some of you more than others; to men the share they have acquired, and to women the share they have acquired. Ask Allah for His grace. For Allah is Omniscient.
To all We have appointed heirs for what their parents and their relatives, and those to whom you have pledged with your own hands, give them their share, for Allah is the Witness of all things.
Men have authority over women because of the favors that Allah bestows on women over women, and also because of the expenditure they make of their property. Righteous women are obedient (to their husbands), and protect what should be protected, during the absence of their husbands, with the protection of Allah. And as for those whose disobedience you fear, exhort them, and depart from them in their beds, and beat them. If they can obey you, then do not look for a way against them, for Allah is indeed High and Great!
If you are afraid of disagreement between the two [spouses], then send an arbiter from his family, and an arbiter from his family. If the two want reconciliation, Allah will restore understanding between them. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing and All-Knowing.
Worship Allah and do not give Him any partners. Be kind to (your) father and mother, the relatives, the orphans, the poor, the near neighbor, the distant neighbor, the colleague and the traveler, and the slaves in your possession, for Allah does not love the presumptuous, the arrogant, the arrogant,
Those who are miserly and command others to be greedy, and hide what Allah has given them by His grace. We have prepared a degrading punishment for the disbelievers.
And those who spend their wealth ostentatiously in front of the people, and do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. Whoever has the Devil for an inseparable comrade, what a bad comrade!
What would they have to reproach themselves for if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent what Allah has given them? Allah, of them, is All-Knowing.
Verily, Allah does not harm anyone, even if it is by the weight of an atom. If it is a good deed, He doubles it, and gives a great reward from Him.
What will they be like when We bring a witness from every community, and We bring you (Muhammad) as a witness against these people?
On that day, those who did not believe and disobeyed the Messenger would prefer that the earth be levelled over them, and they will not be able to hide any word from Allah.
O you who believe! Do not approach the Salat while you are drunk until you understand what you are saying, and also when you are in a state of impurity - unless you are on a journey - until you have taken a ritual bath. If you are sick or travelling, or if one of you returns from the place where he relieved, or if you have touched women and cannot find water, then have recourse to pure earth, and pass it on your faces and on your hands. Allah, verily, is Forgiving and Forgiving.
Have you not (Muhammad) seen those who have received a part of the Book buy error and try to make you go astray from the [right] path?
Allah knows your enemies best. And Allah is sufficient as a protector. And Allah is sufficient as a helper.
There are some among the Jews who distort words from their meaning, and say, "We heard, but we disobeyed," "Listen without your being given to hear," and favor us with "Ra'ina," twisting the tongue and attacking religion. If, on the contrary, they said, "We have heard and obeyed," "Listen," and "Look at us," it would be better for them, and more righteous. But Allah cursed them because of their disbelief; their faith is therefore very mediocre.
O you to whom the Book has been given, believe in what We have sent down, in confirmation of what you already had, before We blotted out faces and turned them upside down, or cursed them as We cursed the people of the Sabbath. For the command of Allah is always carried out.
Verily, Allah does not forgive Him if He is given a partner. Apart from that, He forgives whomever He wills. But whoever gives Allah a partner commits a great sin.
Have you not seen those who declare themselves clean? But it is Allah who purifies whomever He wills; and they shall not be injured, not even by a sprig of date stone.
Look at how they invent lies against Allah. And that's enough of a manifest sin!
Have you not seen those to whom a part of the Book has been given faith in magic (gibt) and Taghhut, and say in favor of those who do not believe, "These are better guided (on the way) than those who have believed"?
These are the ones whom Allah has cursed; and whoever curses Allah, you will never find a helper for him.
Do they have some of the power? So they wouldn't give people anything, not even the hollow of a date pit.
Do they envy people what Allah has given them by His grace? Now We have given to the family of Abraham the Book and Wisdom; and We have given them a great kingdom.
Some of them believed in him, others of them distanced themselves from him. Hell will suffice for them as a flame (to burn there).
Verily, those who do not believe in Our verses, We will soon burn them in the Fire. Whenever their skins have been consumed, We will give them more skins in exchange so that they may taste punishment. Verily, Allah is Mighty and Wise!
And as for those who have believed and done good works, We will soon bring them into the Gardens under which streams flow. They will remain there forever. There will be purified wives for them. And We will bring them in under a thick shade.
Verily, Allah commands you to return the deposits to their beneficiaries, and when you judge among people, to judge fairly. What a good exhortation that Allah gives you! Verily, Allah is the One who hears and sees all things.
O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger and those of you who hold the commandment. Then, if you quarrel about anything, refer it to Allah and to the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. It will be much better and better interpreted (and completed).
Have you not seen those who claim to believe in what was sent down to you [Prophet] and what was sent down before you? They want to take the Taghût as their judge, when it is in him that they have been commanded not to believe. But the Devil wants to lead them astray far away, into error.
And when they are told, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites moving away from you.
How will they act when a calamity befalls them, because of what they have prepared with their own hands? Then they will come to you, swearing by Allah: "We have only wanted good and reconciliation."
These are the ones of whom Allah knows what is in their hearts. Do not hold it against them, but exhort them, and speak convincing words about themselves.
We have sent a Messenger only to be obeyed by the permission of Allah. If, when they have wronged themselves, they come to you and ask for forgiveness from Allah, and if the Messenger asks forgiveness for them, they will find Allah, Most Accepting of Repentance, Merciful.
No!... By your Lord! They will not be believers until they have asked you to judge their disputes, and have not felt any anguish for what you have decided, and they submit completely [to your sentence].
If We had commanded them, "Kill yourselves," or "Come out of your homes," they would not have done it, except for a few of them. If they had done what they were exhorted to do, it would certainly have been better for them, and (their faith) would have been more established.
Then We would certainly have given them a great reward from Us.
and We would have guided them to a straight path.
Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger... these will be with those whom Allah has bestowed with His blessings: the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. And what good companions these are!
This grace comes from Allah. And Allah is sufficient as the Perfect Knower.
O you who believe! Take your precautions and go on expeditions in detachments or en masse.
Verily, there will be someone among you who will delay [going to battle] and if something bad befalls you, he will say: "Verily, Allah has done me a favor because I have not been with them."
and if it is a grace that comes to you from Allah, he will certainly begin to say, as if there were no affection between you and him: "What a pity! If I had been with them, I would have gained a huge gain."
Let them, therefore, fight in the cause of Allah those who exchange this life for the Hereafter. And whoever fights in the cause of Allah, whether killed or victorious, We will soon give him a great reward.
And what have you not to fight in the cause of Allah, and for the cause of the weak: men, women and children who say: "Lord! Bring us out of this city whose people are unjust, and assign us an ally from You, and assign us a helper from You."
The believers fight in the cause of Allah, and those who do not believe fight in the path of the Taghût. Well, fight the Devil's allies, for the Devil's cunning is, indeed, weak.
Have you not seen those who were told: "Abstain from fighting, perform Salat and pay Zakat?" Then when the battle was prescribed to them, behold, some of them began to fear the people as one fears Allah, or even with a still stronger fear, and to say: "O our Lord! Why did You command us to fight? Why didn't You put it off until a little later?" Say: "The enjoyment of this world is ephemeral, but the future life is better for anyone who is pious. And you will not be wronged, even with a sprig of date stone.
Wherever you are, death will reach you, even if you are in impregnable towers. If a good thing befalls them, they say: "It is from Allah." If an evil befalls them, they say: "It is due to you (Muhammad)." Say: "All is of Allah." But what is the matter with these people, that they understand almost no words?
Every good that befalls you comes from Allah, and every evil that befalls you comes from yourself. And we sent you to the people as a messenger. And Allah is sufficient as a witness.
Whoever obeys the Messenger is certainly obeying Allah. And whoever turns his back... We did not send you to them as a guardian.
They say, "Obedience!" Then, as soon as they leave your house, some of them deliberate during the night on something quite different from what they have told you. [However] Allah records what they do at night. So forgive them and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is sufficient as the Protector.
Do they not meditate on the Qur'an? If it came from anyone other than Allah, they would certainly find many contradictions in it.
When they receive reassuring or alarming news, they spread it. If they reported it to the Messenger and the holders of the commandment among them, those of them who seek enlightenment, would have learned (the truth from the mouth of the Prophet and the holders of the commandment). And if it had not been for Allah's grace upon you and His mercy, you would have followed the Devil, except for a few.
Fight in the cause of Allah, you are responsible only for yourself, and incite the believers (to fight). Allah will indeed stop the violence of the disbelievers. Allah is more formidable in strength and more severe in punishment.
Whoever intercedes with good intercession will have a share of it; and whoever intercedes with a bad intercession will bear some of the responsibility. And Allah is Mighty over all things.
If you are greeted, salute in a better way; or else return it (simply). Verily, Allah takes everything into account.
Allah! No god but Him! Most certainly He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection, no doubt about it. And who is more truthful than Allah in word?
What have you to do with dividing yourselves into two factions about hypocrites? Whereas Allah has repressed them (in their unfaithfulness) for what they have acquired. Do you want to guide those whom Allah leads astray? And whoever Allah leads astray, you will not find a way for him.
They would like to see you disbelievers as they disbelieved: then you would all be equal! So do not take allies from among them, until they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn their backs, then seize them, and kill them wherever you find them; and do not take from among them any ally or helper,
except those who join a group with which you have made an alliance, or those who come to you with a heavy heart from having to fight you or their own tribe. If Allah had willed, He would have given them boldness (and strength) against you, and they would certainly have fought you. If they remain neutral towards you and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah does not give you a way against them.
You will find others who seek to have your trust, and at the same time the trust of their own tribe. Whenever they are pushed towards Association (idolatry) they fall back into it en masse. (Therefore,) if they do not remain neutral toward you, do not offer you peace, and do not hold back their hands (from fighting you), then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. Against these We have given you manifest authority.
It is not up to a believer to kill another believer, except by mistake. Whoever kills a believer by mistake, then let him free a believing slave and remit the blood money to his family, unless the family renounces it out of charity. But if [the slain] belonged to a people who were enemies of yours and was a believer, then let a believing slave be freed. If he belonged to a people to whom you are bound by a covenant, then let his family be paid blood money and let a believing slave be freed. Whoever cannot find the means to do so, let him fast for two months in a row to be forgiven by Allah. Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
Whoever intentionally kills a believer, then His reward will be Hell, to dwell there forever. Allah has struck him with His wrath, cursed him, and prepared a great punishment for him.
O you who believe! When you go out to fight in the cause of Allah, see clearly (do not hurry) and do not say to anyone who greets you (from Islam): "You are not a believer," coveting the goods of this world. And it is with Allah that there is much spoils. That's how you were before; then Allah granted you His grace. So see clearly. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of what you do.
Those of the believers who stay at home - except those who have some infirmity - and those who strive for the cause of Allah are not equal. Allah gives those who struggle body and soul a rank of excellence over those who stay at home. And to each one Allah has promised the best reward; and Allah has put the fighters above the non-combatants by granting them immense reward;
degrees of superiority from Him as well as forgiveness and mercy. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Those who have wronged themselves, the Angels will take away their souls, saying, "Where were you?" (about your religion) - "We were powerless on earth," they said. Then the angels will say, "Was not the land of Allah large enough for you to emigrate?" These are those whose refuge is Hell. And what a bad destination!
Except for the helpless: men, women and children, unable to fend for themselves, and who find no way:
To them, Allah may forgive them. Allah is the Merciful and Forgiving.
And whoever emigrates in the cause of Allah will find many refuges and abundance on earth. And whoever goes out of his house, emigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and death comes, his reward belongs to Allah. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And when you walk the earth, it is not a sin for you to shorten Salah, if you fear that the disbelievers will put you to the test, for the disbelievers remain an open enemy to you.
And when you (Muhammad) are among them, and you lead them in Salah, let a group of them stand with you, keeping their weapons. Then when they have finished prostration, let them go behind you and let the other group come, those who have not yet celebrated Salah. It is then up to them to perform Salat with you, taking their precautions and their weapons. The disbelievers would like you to neglect your weapons and baggage so that they can fall on you in one mass. You commit no sin if, inconvenienced by the rain or sick, you lay down your arms; However, take care. Verily, Allah has prepared a degrading punishment for the disbelievers.
When you have performed Salah, call upon the name of Allah, standing, sitting, or lying on your sides. Then when you are safe, perform Salat (normally), because Salat remains a prescription for believers at certain times.
Do not falter in the pursuit of the [enemy] people. If you suffer, he also suffers as you suffer, while you hope for Allah what he does not hope for. Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
We have sent down the Book with the truth to you, so that you may judge among people, according to what Allah has taught you. And don't be the advocate of traitors.
And beg Allah for forgiveness, for Allah is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
And do not argue in favor of those who betray themselves. Allah, indeed, does not love the traitor and the sinner.
They seek to hide from people, but they do not seek to hide from Allah. He is with them when they say things at night that He (Allah) does not accept. And Allah does not cease to understand what they do.
These are the people in whose favor you dispute in this present life. But who is going to argue for them before Allah on the Day of Resurrection? Or who will be their protector?
Whoever does wrong or wrongs himself, and then immediately begs Allah for forgiveness, will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
Whoever acquires a sin, acquires it only against himself. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And whoever acquires a fault or a sin and then accuses an innocent person of it, is then guilty of injustice and manifest sin.
And if it had not been for Allah's grace upon you (Muhammad) and His mercy, some of them would have gladly led you astray. But they only lead astray themselves, and can do you no harm. Allah has sent down upon you the Book and Wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. And Allah's grace upon you is immense.
There is nothing good in the greater part of their secret conversations, unless one of them commands charity, a good deed, or conciliation between people. And whoever does this, seeking the pleasure of Allah, to him We will soon give a great reward.
And whoever splits from the Messenger after the right path has appeared to him and follows a path other than that of the believers, then We will leave him as he has turned away, and burn him in Hell. And what a bad destination!
Verily, Allah does not forgive that He is given partners. Apart from that, He forgives whomever He wills. Whoever gives partners to Allah is going astray, far into error.
They are only females that they invoke, apart from Him. And it is only a rebellious devil that they invoke.
Allah cursed him (the Devil) and he said: "Certainly, I will seize a certain part of Your servants.
Surely I will not fail to lead them astray, I will give them false hopes, I will command them, and they will split the ears of the cattle; I will command them, and they will alter the creation of Allah. And whoever takes the Devil as his ally instead of Allah, will certainly be doomed to obvious destruction.
He makes promises and gives them false hope. And the Devil only makes them deceptive promises.
These are those whose refuge is Hell. And they won't find any way to escape it!
And as for those who have believed and done good works, We will soon bring them into the Gardens under which the streams flow, to dwell there forever. Promise of Allah in truth. And who is more truthful than Allah in word?
This does not depend on your desires or the desires of the People of the Book. Whoever does evil will be rewarded for it, and will not find an ally or helper in his favor except Allah.
And whoever, man or woman, does good deeds, but is a believer... these are the ones who will enter Paradise; and no injustice shall be done to them, even if it be a hollow in the pit of a date.
Who is better in religion than he who submits his being to Allah, while conforming to the revealed Law and following the religion of Abraham, the man of righteousness? And Allah had taken Abraham as his privileged friend.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. And Allah embraces all things.
And they consult you about what has been decreed about women. Say: "Allah gives you His decree on this, in addition to what is recited to you in the Book, concerning orphan girls to whom you do not give what is prescribed to them, and whom you desire to marry, and about minors who are still of low age." You must act fairly towards orphans. And of all that you do that is good, Allah is indeed All-Knowing.
And if a woman fears abandonment or indifference from her husband, then it is not a sin for both if they are reconciled by some compromise, and reconciliation is better, since souls are inclined to ladrery. But if you do good and are pious... Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of what you do.
You can never be fair between your wives, even if you are concerned about it. Don't lean quite towards one of them, to the point of leaving the other as if hanging. But if you are reconciled and you are pious... therefore Allah is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
If the two separate, Allah will grant each of them a different destiny through His bounty. And Allah is full of largesse and Perfectly Wise.
To Allah alone belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. "Fear Allah!" This is what We have enjoined on those to whom the Book was given before you, as well as on yourselves. And if you do not believe (it does not harm Allah, for) surely to Allah alone belongs everything that is in the heavens and on the earth. And Allah is sufficient in Himself and He is worthy of praise.
To Allah alone belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. And Allah is enough to take care of everything.
If He willed, He would make you disappear, O people, and bring in others. For Allah is very capable of this.
Whoever desires the reward of this world, the reward of this world is with Allah, as well as the reward of the Hereafter. And Allah hears and observes everything.
O you who believe! Observe justice strictly and be witnesses as Allah commands, even if it is against yourselves, your father and mother or your close relatives. Whether it is a rich man or a needy man, Allah has priority over both of them (and He knows more about their interest than you). Do not, therefore, follow the passions, so as not to deviate from justice. If you bear false witness or refuse to bear false witness, Allah is the Allafore of what you do.
O you who believe! Be firm in your faith in Allah, in His Messenger, in the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger, and in the Book that He sent down before. Whoever does not believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, is going astray, far into error.
Those who believed, then became disbelievers, then believed again, then became disbelievers again, and only grew in disbelief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will he guide them to a path.
Announce to the hypocrites that there is a painful punishment for them,
Those who take disbelievers instead of believers as allies, is this power that they seek from them? (Verily) the power belongs entirely to Allah.
In the Book He has already revealed to you this: When you hear that the verses of Allah are denied and mocked, do not sit down with them until they start another conversation. If not, you'll be like them. Verily, Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers, all of them, in Hell.
They remain waiting for you; If you have a victory from Allah, they say, "Were we not with you?" and if it benefits the disbelievers, they say to them, "Have we not laid our hands on you to hide you from the believers?" Well, Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will never give a way to the disbelievers against the believers.
Hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but Allah turns their deception (against themselves). And when they get up for Salah, they stand up lazily and ostentatiously to the people. They hardly invoke Allah.
They are undecided (between believers and disbelievers) and do not belong to either of them. And whoever Allah leads astray, you will never find a way for him.
O you who believe! Do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Would you like to give Allah clear evidence against you?
The hypocrites will certainly be in the lowest depths of the Fire, and you will never find a helper for them,
except those who repent, mend their ways, cling firmly to Allah, and have exclusive faith in Him. These will be with the believers. And Allah will give the believers a huge reward.
Why would Allah punish you if you are grateful and believing? Allah is Grateful and All-Knowing.
Allah does not like it when one speaks evil words except when one has been unjustly provoked. And Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
Whether you do good, openly or secretly, or whether you forgive an evil... Then Allah is Forgiving and Omnipotent.
Those who do not believe in Allah and His Messengers, and who want to distinguish between Allah and His Messengers, and who say, "We believe in some of them but do not believe in others," and who want to take an intermediate path (between faith and disbelief),
These are the real disbelievers! And We have prepared for the disbelievers a degrading punishment.
And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers and do not differentiate between them, these are the ones to whom He will give their rewards. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The People of the Book ask you to send down a Book from heaven. They already asked Moses something much more serious when they said, "Let us see Allah in the open." Then lightning struck them for their wrong. Then they adopted the Calf (as an idol) even after the proofs had come to them. We forgave them for this and gave Moses declared authority.
And to (obtain) their commitment, We held up Mount Tor over them, We said to them, "Come in by the door and bow down," We said to them, "Do not transgress the Sabbath," and We made a firm commitment from them.
(We have cursed them) because of their breaking of commitment, their disbelief in the revelations of Allah, their unjustified killing of the prophets, and their saying: "Our hearts are (wrapped) and impervious." In fact, it was Allah who sealed their hearts because of their disbelief, because they believed very little.
And because of their disbelief and the enormous slander they utter against Mary,
and because of their words: "We have truly killed Christ, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah"... But they did not kill him or crucify him; but it was only a pretense! And those who have argued about him are really in a state of uncertainty: they have no certain knowledge of it, they are only following conjectures and they certainly did not kill him,
but Allah has lifted him up to Himself. And Allah is Mighty and Wise.
There will be no one among the People of the Book who will not have faith in Him before His death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them.
It is because of the iniquities of the Jews that We have made unlawful to them the good food that was lawful for them, and also because they obstruct the cause of Allah (to themselves and) to many people,
and because they take usurious interest - which was forbidden to them - and because they illegally eat people's property. To those of them who are disbelievers, We have prepared a painful punishment.
But those of them who are rooted in knowledge, as well as the believers, (all) have faith in what was sent down upon you and what was sent down before you. And as for those who perform Salah, pay Zakat, and believe in Allah and the Last Day, We will give them a great reward.
We have made a revelation to you as We did to Noah and the prophets after him. And We made revelation to Abraham, to Ishmael, to Isaac, to Jacob to the Tribes, to Jesus, to Job, to Jonah, to Aaron and to Solomon, and We gave Zabur to David.
And there are messengers whose story We told you before, and messengers whose story We did not tell you – and Allah spoke to Moses by word of mouth –
as messengers, heralds, and warners, so that after the coming of the messengers there would be no argument for the people before Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
But Allah testifies to what He has sent down to you, He has sent it down in all knowledge. And the Angels testify to this. And Allah is sufficient as a witness.
Those who do not believe and obstruct the path of Allah are indeed going astray in error.
Those who do not believe and practice injustice, Allah is in no way willing to forgive them, nor to guide them in a path
(other) than the way to Hell where they will dwell forever. And this is easy for Allah.
O people! The Messenger has brought you the truth from your Lord. Have faith, therefore, it will be better for you. And if you do not believe (what does it matter!), to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
O People of the Book (Christians), do not exaggerate in your religion, and speak of Allah only the truth. The Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, is only a Messenger of Allah, His word which He sent to Mary, and a breath (of life) from Him. Therefore believe in Allah and His Messengers. And don't say "Three." Stop! It will be better for you. Allah is only one God. He is too glorious to have a child. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth, and Allah is sufficient as protector.
The Messiah never finds it unworthy to be a servant of Allah, nor the angels who are close to Him. And those who find it unworthy to worship Him and puff themselves up with pride... He will gather them all to Himself.
As for those who have believed and done good works, He will give them their full rewards and add to them the increase of His grace. And as for those who have been haughty and puffed up with pride, He will punish them with a painful punishment. And they will not find for them, besides Allah, an ally or a helper,
O people! Verily, a clear proof has come to you from your Lord. And We have sent down to you a bright light.
Then those who believe in Allah and cling to Him, He will bring them into mercy from Him, and into grace as well. And He will guide them to Him in a straight way.
They ask you what has been decreed. Say: "Concerning the deceased who has no father, mother or child, Allah gives you His decree: If anyone dies without a child but has a sister, to her half of what he leaves. And he will inherit from her in full if she has no children. But if he has two sisters (or more), then to them two-thirds of what he leaves; and if he has brothers and sisters, then to one brother belongs a portion equal to that of two sisters. Allah gives you explanations so that you do not go astray. And Allah is All-Knowing.
O you who believe! Faithfully fulfill your commitments. You may have the animal of the flock, except what is stated [as forbidden]. Do not allow yourself to hunt while you are in the state of ihrâm. Verily, Allah decides what He wills.
O you who believe! Do not desecrate the rites of Hajjj of Allah, nor the holy month, nor the sacrificial animals, nor the garlands, nor those who go to the Holy House seeking from their Lord grace and pleasure. Once desecrated, you are free to hunt. And do not let hatred for a people who have obstructed your way to the Holy Mosque incite you to transgress. Help each other in doing good works and godliness, and do not help each other in sin and transgression. And fear Allah, for Allah is indeed harsh in punishment.
You are forbidden to eat the animal that is found dead, the blood, the flesh of a pig, that which has been called for by a name other than that of Allah, the animal that has been choked, the animal that has been knocked down or died by a fall or died by a blow from a horn, and the animal that has been devoured by a ferocious animal, except the one that you slaughter before it is dead. (You are also forbidden to slay the beast) that has been sacrificed on the standing stones, and to divide it by drawing lots by means of arrows. For this is perversity. Today, the disbelievers despair (of turning you away) from your religion, so do not fear them and fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, and performed My blessing on you. And I accept Islam as a religion for you. If anyone is compelled by hunger, without inclination to sin... then, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
They ask you about what is permissible for them. Say: "It is lawful for you to eat good food, as well as what is caught by the predators that you have trained, teaching them what Allah has taught you. Eat of what they catch for you and pronounce the name of Allah on it. And fear Allah. For Allah is swift in reckoning.
"You are allowed, today, good food. You are permitted to eat from the People of the Book, and your own food is permitted to them. (You are lawful) the virtuous women of the believers, and the virtuous women of the people who received the Book before you, if you give them their mahr with a marriage contract, not as debauched people or as lover-takers. And whoever renounces the faith, then vain becomes his action, and he will be in the Hereafter, among the losers
O you who believe! When you get up for Salah, wash your faces and hands up to your elbows; Run wet hands over your heads. and wash your feet up to your ankles. And if you are polluted "junub", then purify yourself (by a bath); but if you are sick, or on a journey, or if one of you returns from the place where he relieved himself, or if you have touched the women and cannot find water, then have recourse to the pure earth, and pass it over your faces and your hands. Allah does not want to put any discomfort on you, but He wants to purify you and perfect His blessing on you. Maybe you'll be grateful.
And remember the blessing of Allah upon you, as well as the covenant He made with you, when you said, "We have heard and we have obeyed." And fear Allah. For Allah knows perfectly well the contents of hearts.
O you who believe! Be strict (in your duties) to Allah and (be) fair witnesses. And that hatred for a people does not incite you to be unjust. Practice fairness: this is closer to godliness. And fear Allah. For Allah is indeed Knower of what you do.
Allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds that there will be forgiveness and a huge reward for them.
As for those who do not believe and treat Our proofs as lies, these are people from Hell.
O you who believe! Remember the blessing of Allah on you on the day when a group of enemies was about to lay hands on you and He repulsed their attempt. And fear Allah. It is in Allah that the believers must put their trust.
And Allah certainly took the pledge of the children of Israel. We appointed twelve chiefs from among them. And Allah said: "I am with you, provided that you perform Salah, pay Zakat, believe in My Messengers, help them and make a good loan to Allah. Then, certainly, I will blot out your misdeeds, and bring you into the Gardens under which the streams flow. And whoever among you after this disbelieves, is certainly going astray."
And then, because of their violation of the commitment, We have cursed them and hardened their hearts: they turn the words away from their meaning and forget part of what they have been reminded of. You will not cease to discover their treachery, except for a small number of them. Forgive them, therefore, and forget [their sins]. For Allah certainly loves the doers.
And of those who say, "We are Christians," We have made their commitment. But they have forgotten part of what they were reminded of. So We stirred up enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will inform them of what they were doing.
O People of the Book! Our Messenger (Muhammad) has indeed come to you, exposing to you much of what you hid from the Book, and passing over many other things! A light and an explicit Book have come to you from Allah!
By this (the Qur'an), Allah guides to the paths of salvation those who seek His pleasure. And He brings them out of darkness into light by His grace. And He guides them to a straight path.
Verily, those who say, "Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary?" - say: "Who has anything from Allah (to prevent Him), if He wanted to destroy the Messiah, the son of Mary, and his mother and all those who are on earth?... To Allah alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and of what lies between the two." He creates what He wants. And Allah is Omnipotent.
The Jews and Christians said, "We are the sons of Allah and His favorites." Say: "Why then does He punish you for your sins?" In fact, you are human beings from those whom He created. He forgives whom He wills and He chastises whom He wills. And to Allah alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that which lies between the two. And it is to Him that the final destination will be.
O People of the Book! Our Messenger (Muhammad) came to enlighten you after an interruption of the Messengers so that you would not say, "There has come to us neither a herald nor a warner." Surely a herald and a warner has come to you. And Allah is Omnipotent.
(Remember) When Moses said to his people, "O my people! Remember the blessing of Allah upon you, when He appointed prophets from among you. And He has made you kings. And He has given you what He had not given to any one else in the worlds.
O my people! Enter the holy land that Allah has commanded you. And do not turn back [by refusing to fight] for you will return losers.
They said, "O Moses, there is a people of giants there. We will never enter it until they come out. If they leave, then we will enter."
Two men of those who feared Allah and were showered with blessings by Him said, "Enter them through the gate; and when you have entered it, you will undoubtedly be the dominant. And it is in Allah that you must trust, if you are believers."
They said, "Moses! We will never enter it, as long as they are there. Go, then, you and your Lord, and fight together. We stay where we are."
He said, "Lord! I have no power, truly, except over myself and over my brother: separate us therefore from this perverse people."
He (Allah) said: "Well, this land will be forbidden to them for forty years, during which time they will wander the earth. Do not worry about this evil people."
And tell them the truth the story of the two sons of Adam. Both offered sacrifices; that of one was accepted and that of the other was not. He said, "I will surely kill you." "Allah accepts," says the other, "only from the pious."
If you stretch out your hand to kill me, I will not stretch out my hand to kill you to you, for I fear Allah, the Lord of the universe.
I want you to leave with the sin of having killed me and with your own sin: then you will be among the people of the Fire. This is the reward of the unjust.
His soul incited him to kill his brother. So he killed him and thus became one of the losers.
Then Allah sent a raven who began to scratch the earth to show him how to bury his brother's corpse. He said, "Woe to me! Am I incapable of being able, like this raven, to bury my brother's corpse?" He then became one of those who are gnawed by remorse.
Therefore We have ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a person who is not guilty of murder or corruption on earth, it is as if he had killed all men. And whoever gives him life, it is as if he were giving life to all men. Indeed, Our Messengers came to them with the proofs. And then, in spite of this, many of them begin to commit excesses on earth.
The reward for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and who strive to sow corruption in the earth, is that they will be killed, or crucified, or that their opposite hands and legs will be cut off, or that they will be expelled from the land. It will be ignominy for them here below; and in the Hereafter there will be a great punishment for them,
except those who repented before they fell into your power: know that then Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who believe! Fear Allah, seek a way to draw closer to Him, and strive for His cause. Maybe you will be one of those who succeed!
If the disbelievers possessed all that is on earth, and even more, to redeem themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them. And for them there will be a painful punishment.
They will want to come out of the Fire, but they will not come out of it. And they will have permanent punishment.
The thief and the thief both cut off their hands, as a punishment for what they have acquired, and as a punishment from Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
But whoever repents after his sin and reforms, Allah accepts his repentance. For Allah is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He chastises whom He wills and forgives whomever He wills. And Allah is Omnipotent.
O Messenger! Let not those afflict you who concur in disbelief; among those who have said, "We have believed" with their mouths without their hearts ever having believed, and among the Jews who like to listen to lies and listen to other people who have never come to you and who distort the meaning of words once they are well established. They say, "If you have received this, accept it, and if you have not received it, be suspicious." Whoever Allah wants to test, you have no protection for him from Allah. These are the people whose hearts Allah did not want to purify. To them will be reserved an ignominy here below and an enormous punishment in the hereafter.
They are alert to lies and greedy for illicit gains. If they come to you, be a judge among them or turn away from them. And if you turn away from them, they will never be able to do you any harm. And if you judge, then judge between them in equity. For Allah loves those who judge fairly.
But how can they ask you to be their judge when they have the Torah with them, in which the judgment of Allah is found? And then, after that, they reject your judgment. These people are not believers at all.
We have sent down the Torah in which there is guidance and light. It is on the basis of this that the prophets who have submitted to Allah, as well as the rabbis and doctors, judge the affairs of the Jews. For they have been entrusted with the custody of the Book of Allah, and they are witnesses of it. So don't fear people, but fear Me. And do not sell My teachings at a low price. And those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down, they are the disbelievers.
And We have prescribed for them life for life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth. Injuries fall under the law of retaliation. Afterwards, whoever renounces it out of charity, it will earn him expiation. And those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down, these are unjust.
And We sent after them Jesus, the son of Mary, to confirm what was in the Torah before him. And We gave him the Gospel, where there is guidance and light, to confirm what was in the Torah before him, and a guide and an exhortation for the pious.
Let the people of the Gospel judge according to what Allah has sent down to it. Those who do not judge according to what Allah has sent down are the wicked ones.
And upon you (Muhammad) We sent down the Book with the truth, to confirm the Book that was there before it and to prevail over it. Judge among them, therefore, according to what Allah has sent down. Do not follow their passions, far from the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have assigned legislation and a plan to follow. If Allah had willed, He would have made you all one community. But He wants to test you in what He gives you. Compete in the right hearts. To Allah is the return of you all; then He will inform you of what you differed in.
Then judge among them according to what Allah has sent down. Do not follow their passions, and take care that they do not try to distance you from some of what Allah has revealed to you. And then, if they refuse (the revealed judgment), know that Allah wants to afflict them [here below] for some of their sins. Many people, of course, are perverts.
Is it then the judgment of the time of Ignorance that they seek? What is better than Allah in judging people who have a firm faith?
O you who believe! Do not take Jews and Christians as allies; they are allies of each other. And whoever among you takes them as allies, becomes one of them. Allah does not guide the unrighteous.
You will see, moreover, that those who have sickness in their hearts rush to them and say: "We fear that a reversal of fortune will befall us." But perhaps Allah will bring victory or a command from Him. Then they will regret their secret thoughts.
And the believers will say: "Are these those who swore by Allah with all their strength that they were with you?" But their actions became futile and they became losers.
O you who believe! Whoever among you apostatizes from his religion... Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, modest towards the believers and proud and powerful towards the disbelievers, who strive in the cause of Allah, fearing no blame from any blame. This is the grace of Allah. He gives it to whomever He wills. Allah is Immense and All-Knowing.
You have no allies but Allah, His Messenger, and the believers who perform Salah, pay Zakat, and bow (to Allah).
And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and the believers as his allies, [will succeed] because it is the party of Allah that will be victorious.
O you who believe! Do not adopt as your allies those who mock your religion, among those to whom the Book was given before you and among the disbelievers. And fear Allah if you are believers.
And when you call for salah, they take it as a mockery and a game. It is because they are people who do not reason.
Say: "O People of the Book! Do you reproach us for anything other than believing in Allah, in what has been sent down to us and what has been sent down before? But most of you are perverts.
Say: "May I tell you what is worse in terms of retribution with Allah? Whoever Allah has cursed, whoever has incurred His wrath, and those whom He has made monkeys, pigs, and likewise, whoever worshipped the Taghût, these have the worst of places and are the most strayed from the straight path."
When they come to you, they say, "We believe." Whereas they went in with disbelief and they went out with it. And Allah knows perfectly well what they are hiding.
And you will see many of them rushing to sin and iniquity, and eating illicit gains. How bad is what they do!
Why don't the rabbis and the doctors (of the religious law) prevent them from speaking lies and eating illicit gains? How evil are their deeds!
And the Jews say: "The hand of Allah is closed!" Let their own hands be closed, and cursed be they for saying so. Rather, His two hands are wide open: He distributes His gifts as He wills. And verily, what has been sent down to you from your Lord will cause rebellion and disbelief to increase greatly among them. We have spread enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they light a fire for war, Allah extinguishes it. And they strive to sow disorder on the earth, while Allah does not like the sowers of disorder.
If the People of the Book had faith and godliness, We would certainly have blotted out their misdeeds and brought them into the Gardens of Earthly Delight.
If they had applied the Torah and the Gospel and what came down upon them from their Lord, they would certainly have enjoyed what is above them and what is under their feet. There is a group among them that acts righteously; but for many of them, how bad is what they do!
O Messenger, convey what has been sent down to you from your Lord. If you didn't, then you wouldn't have communicated His message. And Allah will protect you from people. Verily, Allah does not guide people who disbelieve.
Say: "O People of the Book, you do not stand by anything until you conform to the Torah and the Gospel and to what has been sent down to you from your Lord." And verily, what has been sent down to you from your Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief. So don't worry about disbelievers.
Those who have believed, those who have become Judaized, the Sabaeans, and the Christians, those among them who believe in Allah, in the Last Day and who do good deeds, do not fear them, and they will not be afflicted.
Of course, We had already made the commitment of the Children of Israel, and We had sent messengers to them. But whenever a Messenger comes to them with what they do not want, they call some liars and they kill others.
Trusting that there would be no temptation against them, they had become blind and deaf. Then Allah welcomed their repentance. Then many of them became blind and deaf again. And Allah sees perfectly what they are doing.
Verily, they are disbelievers who say: "Verily, Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary." While the Messiah said, "O children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Whoever associates Allah (other gods) with Allah forbids him Paradise; and his refuge will be Fire. And for the unjust, there are no helpers!
They are disbelievers who say, "Verily, Allah is the third of three." When there is no deity but One Deity! And if they do not cease to say so, surely a painful punishment will befall the disbelievers among them.
Will they not repent to Allah and beg His forgiveness? For Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger. Messengers passed before him. And his mother was a truthful woman. And both consumed food. See how We explain the proofs to them, and then see how they turn away.
Say: "Do you worship instead of Allah that which has no power to do you evil or good?" Allah is the Hearer and the All-Knowing.
Say: "O People of the Book, do not exaggerate in your religion, opposing the truth. Do not follow the passions of people who have gone astray before this, who have led many people astray, and who have gone astray from the right path.
Those of the Children of Israel who did not believe were cursed by the mouth of David and Jesus, the son of Mary, because they disobeyed and transgressed.
They did not forbid each other what they did that was blameworthy. How bad, indeed, is what they did!
You see many of them allying themselves with the disbelievers. How evil is that which their souls have prepared for themselves, so that they have incurred the wrath of Allah, and it is in torment that they will eternalize.
If they believed in Allah, the Prophet and what has been sent down to him, they would not take these disbelievers as allies. But many of them are perverse.
You will certainly find that the Jews and the associates are the bitterest enemies of the believers. And you will certainly find that those who are most disposed to love believers are those who say, "We are Christians." It is because there are priests and monks among them, and they are not puffed up with pride.
And when they hear what has been sent down upon the Messenger [Muhammad], you see their eyes overflowing with tears, because they have recognized the truth. They say, "O our Lord! We believe: So register us among those who testify (to the truthfulness of the Qur'an).
Why should we not believe in Allah and in what has come to us from the truth. Why do we not covet that our Lord should bring us into the company of the virtuous?"
Therefore Allah rewards them for what they say with gardens under which the streams flow, where they will dwell forever. Such is the reward of the beneficent.
And as for those who do not believe and who treat Our verses as lies, they are the people of the Furnace.
O you who believe: do not declare unlawful the good things that Allah has made lawful for you. And don't transgress. Allah, (verily,) does not love transgressors.
And eat of what Allah has given you that is lawful and good. Fear Allah, in whom you have faith.
Allah does not punish you for frivolity in your oaths, but He punishes you for the oaths you intend to perform. The atonement will be to feed ten poor people, with what you normally feed your families, or to clothe them, or to free a slave. Whoever cannot afford it must fast for three days. This is the expiation for your oaths, when you have sworn. And hold fast to your oaths. So Allah explains His verses to you, so that you may be thankful!
O you who believe! Wine, gambling, standing stones, divination arrows are nothing but an abomination, the work of the Devil. Depart from it, that you may succeed.
The Devil only wants to sow enmity and hatred among you through wine and gambling, and to turn you away from calling on Allah and Salah. Are you going to put an end to it?
Obey Allah, obey the Messenger, and beware! If you then turn away... then know that it is only the responsibility of Our Messenger to convey the message clearly.
It is not a sin for those who have faith and do good works in that they have consumed (wine and gambling before they were forbidden), provided they are pious (avoiding forbidden things after they have knowledge of them) and believe (accepting their prohibition) and do good works; and then (continue) to be pious and to believe, and (remain) pious and beneficent. For Allah loves the doers.
O you who believe! Allah will certainly test you with some game within the reach of your hands and spears. This is so that Allah may know the one who fears Him in secret. Whoever transgresses after this will have a painful punishment.
O you who believe! Do not kill game while you are in the state of Ihram. Whoever among you kills them deliberately, then he compensates for it either by some herd animal, similar to what he has killed, according to the judgment of two upright people among you, and this as an offering which he will send to the Ka'aba, or by expiation, by feeding the poor, or by the equivalent in fasting. This is so that he can taste the bad consequence of his act. Allah has forgiven what has happened; but whoever reoffends, Allah will punish him. Allah is the Mighty and the Possessor of the power to punish.
Hunting at sea is permitted to you, and also to eat it, for your enjoyment and that of the travellers. And it is unlawful for you to hunt on land as long as you are in the state of Ihram. And fear Allah to whom you will be gathered.
Allah has instituted the Ka'aba, the Sacred House, as a gathering place for people. (He has instituted) the holy month, the offering (of animals,) and the garlands, so that you may know that truly Allah knows all that is in the heavens and on the earth; and that Allah is truly All-Knowing.
Know that Allah is severe in punishment, but also that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
It is only the responsibility of the Messenger to convey (the message). And Allah knows what you divulge as well as what you hide.
Say: "The bad and the good are not alike, even if the abundance of evil deceives you. Fear Allah, therefore, O intelligent people, so that you may succeed.
O you who believe! Don't ask about things that, if disclosed to you, would upset you. And if you ask about them, while the Qur'an is revealed, they will be disclosed to you. Allah has forgiven you for this. And Allah is Forgiving and Forgiving.
A people before you had asked questions (similar) and then became disbelievers by their own doing.
Allah has not instituted the Bahira, the Saïba, the Wasîlani the Hâm. But those who disbelieved invented this lie against Allah, and most of them do not reason.
And when it is said to them, "Come to that which Allah has sent down (the Revelation), and to the Messenger," they say, "It is enough for us to do what we found our ancestors on." What! Even if their ancestors knew nothing and were not on the right path...?
O you who believe! You are responsible for yourselves! He who goes astray will not harm you if you have taken the right path. To Allah you will all return; then He will inform you of what you were doing.
O you who believe! When death comes to one of you, the will will be witnessed by two men of integrity among you, or two others, not of yours, if you are on a journey in the world and death strikes you. You shall retain them (the two witnesses) after the Sal?t, and then, if you have any doubts, you shall make them swear by Allah: "We do not trade or profit with this, even if it is a relative, and we will not hide the testimony of Allah. Otherwise, we would be among the sinners."
If it is discovered that these two witnesses are guilty of sin, two others who are more upright, among those who have been wronged, will take their place and both will swear by Allah: "Verily, our testimony is more righteous than the testimony of these two; and we do not transgress. Otherwise, we would certainly be among the unjust."
This is the surest way to induce them to give the testimony in its real form; or to make them fear that other oaths will be substituted for their own. And fear Allah and listen. Allah does not guide evil people.
(Remember) the Day when Allah gathers (all) the Messengers, and He says: "What has been given to you as an answer?" They will say: "We have no knowledge: you are truly the great knower of all that is unknown."
And when Allah will say: "O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My blessing on you and your mother when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit. In the cradle you talked to people, just like in your middle age. I taught you the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel! You made clay like a bird shape by My permission; then you blew into it. Then by My permission, she became a bird. And you healed by My permission, the man born blind and the leper. And by My permission, you were reviving the dead. I protected you from the Children of Israel while you brought them the evidence. But those of them who did not believe said, "This is just obvious magic."
And when I revealed to the Apostles this: "Believe in Me and in My Messenger (Jesus)". They said, "We believe; and attests that we are fully submissive."
Remember the moment when the Apostles said: "O Jesus, son of Mary, can it be that your Lord sends down upon us from heaven a table served?" He said to them: "Fear Allah if you are believers."
They said, "We want to eat of it, to reassure our hearts, to know that you have really told us the truth, and to be among the witnesses of it."
"O Allah our Lord," says Jesus, son of Mary, "send down upon us from heaven a table that will be a feast for us, for the first of us, as well as for the last, and a sign from You.
"Yes," says Allah, "I will send it down upon you. But then, whoever of you refuses to believe, I will punish him with a punishment that I will not chastise anyone else in the universe."
(Remind them) of the time when Allah will say: "O Jesus, son of Mary, was it you who said to the people: 'Take me and my mother for two gods besides Allah?' He will say, "Glory and purity be to You! It is not for me to declare what I am not allowed to say! If I had said it, You would have known it, indeed. You know what's in me, and I don't know what's in you. You are, in truth, the great connoisseur of all that is unknown.
I told them only what You commanded me, "Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." And I was a witness against them as long as I was among them. Then when You called me back, You were their watchful observer. And You're a witness to all things.
If You chastise them, they are Your servants. And if You forgive them, You are the Mighty, the Wise."
Allah will say: "This is the day when their truthfulness will benefit the truthful: they will have gardens under which the streams flow, to dwell in them forever." Allah has accepted them and they have accepted Him. This is the enormous success.
To Allah alone belongs the kingdom of the heavens, the earth and all that is in them. And He is Omnipotent.
Praise be to Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, and established darkness and light. Yet the disbelievers give equals to their Lord.
It is He who created you from clay; then he decreed a term for you, and there is a term fixed with him. Yet, you still doubt!
And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth. He knows what you hide inside you and what you divulge and He knows what you acquire.
And none of the signs come to them from among the signs of their Lord, without their turning away from them.
They call the truth a lie when it comes to them. But they will have news of what they are making fun of.
Have they not seen how many generations before them We have destroyed, to whom We had given power on earth, far more than We have given you? We had sent rain upon them from the sky in abundance, and We had caused rivers to flow at their feet. Then We destroyed them for their sins; and We have created a new generation after them.
Even if We had sent down upon you (Muhammad) a paper Book that they could touch with their hands, those who do not believe would certainly have said, "This is just obvious magic."
And they say, "Why was not an angel sent down upon him (Muhammad)?" If We had sent down an Angel, it would surely have been the case; then they would not have been given a delay.
If We had appointed an angel [as a prophet], We would have made him a man and caused them the same confusion that they are in.
Of course, messengers have been mocked before you, but those who mocked them, their own mockery enveloped them.
Say: "Go through the earth and see what has become of those who called the truth a lie."
Say: "To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To Allah." He has prescribed mercy to Himself. He will certainly gather you together on the Day of Resurrection: there is no doubt about it. Those who make their own destruction are those who do not believe.
And to Him all that dwells in night and day. He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
Say: "Should I take as an ally other than Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He is the one who feeds and no one feeds Him. Say: "I have been commanded to be the first to submit." And never be among the associates.
Say: "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a dreadful day."
On this day, whoever is spared, it is because [Allah] has had mercy on him. And here is the resounding success.
And if Allah causes a calamity to befall you, no one but Him can take it away. And if He makes a happiness touch you... it is because He is Omnipotent.
He is the Supreme Ruler over His servants; He is the Wise, the Perfected Knower.
Say: "What is greater in the way of testimony?" Say: "Allah is a witness between me and you; and this Qur'an has been revealed to me so that I may warn you and all whom it will reach through it. "Are you really the one who testifies that there are other gods with Allah? Say: "I do not testify." Say [also]: "There is only one Deity. And I disavow what you associate with (Him)."
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize (the Messenger Muhammad) as they recognize their own children. Those who make their own destruction are those who do not believe.
Who is more unjust than the one who invents a lie against Allah, or who calls His verses a lie? The unrighteous will not succeed.
And on the Day when We will gather them all together and say to those who have given partners: "Where are your associates that you claimed?"
Then they will have no excuse but to say, "By Allah our Lord! We were never associates."
See how they lie to themselves! And how do they (the associates) abandon them that they invented!
There are some among them who come to listen to you, while We have veiled their hearts, which prevent them from understanding (the Qur'an), and in their ears is a heaviness. Even if they saw all kinds of evidence, they would not believe it. And when they come to argue with you, those who do not believe then say, "These are only legends of the ancients."
They prevent [people] from approaching him and keep themselves away from him. They will only destroy themselves without realizing it.
If you see them, when they are placed before the Fire. Then they will say, "Alas! If we could be sent back (to the earth), we would no longer treat the verses of our Lord as lies, and we would be among the believers."
Of course not! Behold, what they hid before will appear to them. Now, if they were restored [to earthly life], they would surely return to what was forbidden to them. They are really liars.
And they say, "There is no other life for us than this world; and we will not be resurrected."
If you see them, when they appear before their Lord. He will say to them, "Is this not the truth?" They will say: "But yes! By our Lord!" And he will say, "Then taste the punishment for not believing."
Of course, those who call the encounter with Allah a lie are losers. And when suddenly the Hour comes to them, they will say, "Woe to us for our neglect of him, and they will bear their burdens on their backs, and what evil burdens!
The present life is all about play and fun. The dwelling place in the Hereafter will be better for those who are pious. Well, don't you understand?
We know that in truth what they say grieves you. But they really do not believe that you are a liar, but the verses of Allah that the wrongdoers deny.
Verily, messengers before you (Muhammad) were called liars. They then endured steadfastly being called liars and persecuted, until Our help came to them. And no one can change the words of Allah, and a part of the history of the Messengers has already come to you.
And if their indifference grieves you greatly, and it is in your power to seek a tunnel through the earth, or a ladder to go to heaven to bring them a miracle, [do it, then]. And if Allah willed, He could put them all on the right path. Do not be among the ignorant.
Only those who hear respond to the call [of faith]. And as for the dead, Allah will raise them up; then they will be brought back to Him.
And they say, "Why was not a miracle sent down upon him (Muhammad) from his Lord?" Say: "Verily, Allah is able to bring down a miracle. But most of them don't know."
There is no beast walking on the ground, no bird flying its wings, that is not like you in community. We have not omitted anything to write in the Book. Then they will be brought back to their Lord.
And those who call lies Our verses are deaf and dumb in darkness. Allah leads astray whomever He wills; and He places whomever He wants on a straight path.
Say: "Inform me: If the punishment of Allah comes to you, or the Hour comes to you, will you call on anyone but Allah, if you are truthful?"
Rather, you will appeal to Him. Then He will dissipate, if He wills, the object of your call, and you will forget what you associate with Him.
We have indeed sent (messengers) to the communities before you. Then We seized them with adversity and distress - perhaps they will beg (for mercy)! -
Why, then, when Our severity came to them, did they not implore (mercy)? But their hearts had hardened, and the Devil was embellishing in their eyes what they were doing.
Then, when they had forgotten what they had been reminded of, We opened to them the doors to all things; and when they had rejoiced at what had been given them, We suddenly seized them, and they were in despair.
Thus was the last remnant of these unrighteous men exterminated. And praise be to Allah, Lord of the Universe!
Say: "See? If Allah were to take your hearing and sight, and seal your hearts, what god but Allah would restore them to you? See how, for them, We clarify the evidence! Yet they turn away from it.
Say: "What do you think? If Allah's punishment comes to you unexpectedly or in broad daylight, who will be destroyed if not the unrighteous people?"
We send messengers only as heralds and warners: therefore those who believe and reform, have no fear over them, and they will not be afflicted.
And those who treat Our proofs as lies, the punishment will come upon them, because of their wickedness.
Say to them: "I do not tell you that I have the treasures of Allah, nor that I know the Unknowable, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I am only following what is revealed to me." Say: "Are the blind equal to the one who sees? Don't you think?"
And warned by this (the Qur'an), those who fear to be gathered before their Lord, that they will have no ally or intercessor besides Allah besides Allah. Maybe they would become pious!
And do not reject those who, morning and evening, cry out to their Lord, seeking his "Wajh" Face. To hold them to account is not your responsibility, and to hold you to account is not their responsibility in any way. If you reject them, you would be among the unjust.
So We test one another, so that they say: "Are these those whom Allah has favored among us?" Doesn't Allah know best which ones are grateful?
And when those who believe in our verses (the Qur'an) come to you, say: "Peace be upon you! Your Lord has prescribed mercy to Himself. And whoever of you has done evil through ignorance, and then repented and reformed... He is, then, Forgiving and Merciful."
This is how We detail the verses, so that the path of the criminals may be clearly seen.
Say: "It has been forbidden for me to worship those whom you pray to except Allah." Say: "I will not follow your passions, for that would be to go astray, and I would no longer be among the rightly guided."
Say: "I stand by a clear proof from my Lord, and you have called it a lie. What (the chastisement) you want to hasten does not depend on me. Judgment belongs only to Allah, for He is the true ruler and He is the best of judges.
Say: "If what you want to hasten were up to me, it would be a matter between you and me." Allah knows the wrongdoers best.
It is He who holds the keys to the Unknowable. No one but Him knows them. And He knows what is on dry land, as in the sea. And not a leaf falls that He doesn't know. And there is not a seed in the darkness of the earth, nothing fresh or dry, that is not recorded in an explicit book.
And at night He takes your souls, and He knows what you have gained during the day. Then He raises you up on the day so that the appointed term may be fulfilled. Then it is to Him that your return will be, and He will inform you of what you were doing.
And He is the Supreme Ruler over His servants. And He sends guards upon you. And when death befalls one of you, Our Messengers (the Angels) take away his soul without any negligence.
They are then brought back to Allah, their true Master. He is the one who judges and He is the most prompt of judges.
Say: "Who delivers you from the darkness of the earth and the sea?" You humbly and secretly invoke Him: "If He delivers us from this, we will be among the grateful.
Say: "It is Allah who delivers you from it and from all anguish. Yet you give Him associates."
Say: "He is able to bring punishment against you from above, or from under your feet, or to confound you in sectarianism. And He makes you taste the ardor [of battle] to one another." Look at how We set forth Our verses. Maybe they will understand?
And your people call this (the Qur'an) a lie, when it is the truth. Say: "I am not your guarantor.
Each announcement arrives in its time and place. And soon you'll find out."
When you see those who are wading in discussions about Our verses, stay away from them until they start another discussion. And if the Devil makes you forget, then, as soon as you remember, do not stay with the unjust.
It is not the responsibility of those who are pious to give an account for these people. But this is as a reminder. Perhaps they will fear [Allah].
Leave those who take their religion for play and amusement, and who are seduced by life on earth. And by this (the Qur'an) reminds us that so that a soul does not expose itself to its destruction according to what it has acquired, it will have no ally or intercessor besides Allah. And whatever compensation she offers, she will not be accepted by her. These have given themselves up to their perdition because of what they have acquired. Their drink will be boiling water, and they will have a painful punishment for having disbelieved.
Say: "Shall we invoke instead of Allah that which cannot benefit or harm us? And shall we come back on our heels after Allah has guided us, as one who has been seduced by the devils and who wanders perplexed on the earth, although friends call him to the right path (saying to him): "Come to us". Say: "The true way is the way of Allah. And we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the universe,
And to perform Salat and to fear Him. To Him you will be gathered."
And it is He who created the heavens and the earth, in all truth. And the day that He said, "Be." That's it, His word is the truth. To Him alone is the kingdom on the day when the trumpet is blown. He is the Knower of what is veiled and what is manifest. And He is the Wise and the Perfected Knower.
(Recall the time) when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols as deities? I see you and your people in an obvious way!"
Thus We showed Abraham the kingdom of heaven and earth, that he might be one of those who believe with conviction.
When night enveloped him, he looked at a star, and said, "This is my Lord!" Then, when she disappeared, he said, "I don't like things that disappear."
When he then observed the moon rising, he said, "This is my Lord!" Then, when she disappeared, he said, "If my Lord does not guide me, I will certainly be one of the misguided."
When he then observed the rising sun, he said, "This is my Lord! This one is greater" Then when the sun disappeared, he said, "O my people, I disavow everything that you associate with Allah.
I turn my face exclusively to Him who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth; and I am not one of those who give Him associates."
His people disputed with him; but he said, "Are you going to argue with me about Allah, when He has guided me? I am not afraid of the partners you give Him. I fear only what my Lord wants. My Lord embraces all things in His knowledge. Don't you remember?
And how can I be afraid of the partners you give Him, when you have not been afraid to associate with Allah things for which He has not sent down any evidence to you? Which of the two parties has the greater right to security? (Say it) if you know.
Those who have believed and have not disturbed the purity of their faith by some inequity (association), these have security; and they are the rightly guided."
This is the argument which We inspired in Abraham against his people. We raise to high rank whomever We will. Your Lord is Wise and All-Knowing.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them both. And Noah, We have guided him before, and among the descendants (of Abraham) (or Noah), David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. And this is how We reward the beneficial.
In the same way, Zechariah, John the Baptist, Jesus, and Elijah, all of whom are among the good.
Likewise, Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah and Lot. Each of them We have favored above the rest of the world.
Likewise some of their ancestors, their descendants and their brothers and We have chosen them and guided them to a straight path.
This is the direction in which Allah guides whomever He wills among His servants. But if they had given Allah partners, then all that they would have done would certainly have been in vain.
To them We have brought the Book, wisdom and prophecy. If these others do not believe in them, at least We have confided these things to people who do not deny them.
These are the ones whom Allah has guided: follow their direction. Say: "I do not ask you for a salary for this." It is only a reminder to the whole universe.
They do not appreciate Allah as He deserves when they say, "Allah has not sent anything down on a human." Say: "Who sent down the Book that Moses brought as a light and guide to the people? You put it in sheets, to show a part of it, while hiding a lot. You have been taught what you and your ancestors did not know. Say: "This is Allah." And then, let them have fun in their wandering.
This is a blessed Book (the Qur'an) that We have sent down, confirming what already existed before it, so that you may warn the Mother of Cities (Makkah) and the people around it. Those who believe in the Last Day, believe in it and remain assiduous in their Salah.
And what worse unjust person than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah or who says, "Revelation has been made to me," when nothing has been revealed to him. The same is true of the one who says: "I am going to send down something like what Allah has sent down." If you would see the unrighteous when they are in the throes of death, and the angels will stretch out their hands to them (saying), "Let your souls go out. Today you will be rewarded with the punishment of humiliation for what you said about Allah other than the truth and because you proudly turned away from His teachings."
And here you are coming to Us, alone, just as We created you the first time, leaving behind your backs all that We had bestowed upon you. We do not see you accompanied by the intercessors whom you pretended to be associates. There has certainly been a rupture between you: they have abandoned you, those whom you claimed (to be your intercessors).
It is Allah who splits the seed and the stone: from the dead he brings out the living, and from the living he brings out the dead. This is Allah. How, then, do you allow yourself to be diverted?
Splitter of the dawn, He has made the night a phase of rest; the sun and the moon to measure time. This is the order conceived by the Mighty, the All-Knowing.
And it is He who has assigned you the stars, so that through them you may be guided in the darkness of the earth and the sea. Verily, We expose the proofs for those who know!
And it is He who created you from a single person (Adam). And there is a dwelling place and a place of deposit (for you.) We have laid out the evidence for those who understand.
And it was He who brought down the water from heaven. Then by it We caused every plant to germinate, from which We brought forth a verdure, from which We produced grains, superimposed one on top of the other; and of the palm tree, of its spathe, of the bunches of dates that are stretched out. And also the grape gardens, the olive and the pomegranate, similar or different from each other. Look at their fruits as they are produced and ripened. These are signs for those who have faith.
And they have appointed partners with Allah, the jinn, even though it is He who created them. And they have invented for Him, in their ignorance, sons and daughters, Glory to Him! He transcends everything they attribute to him.
Creator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a child when He has no partner? He is the One who created everything, and He is All-Knowing.
This is Allah your Lord! There is no divinity but He, the Creator of all. Worship Him, then. He is in charge of everything.
Eyes cannot reach Him, while He seizes all eyes. And He is the Sweet, the Perfected Knower.
Verily, there have been clear proofs of your Lord coming to you. Therefore, whoever sees clearly, it is in his favor; and whoever remains blind, it is to his detriment, for I am in no way charged with your safeguard.
This is how We explain the verses. And that they might say, "You have studied." And in order to expose it clearly to people who know.
Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but Him. And keep away from the associates.
Allah willing, they would not be associates! But We have not appointed you as guardian over them; and you are not their guarantor.
Do not insult those whom they invoke except Allah, for by aggressiveness they would be insulting Allah in their ignorance. In the same way, We have embellished (in the eyes of) each community its own action. Then it is to their Lord that their return will be; and He will inform them of what they were doing.
And they swear by Allah with all the force of their oaths, that if a miracle were to happen to them, they would believe in it (without hesitation,) Say: "Verily, miracles depend only on Allah." But what makes you think that when this happens, they won't believe it?
Because they did not believe the first time, we will turn away their hearts and their eyes; we will let them march blindly in their rebellion.
And if We were to send down the angels to them, [as they had proposed] if the dead spoke to them, and if We gathered all things before them, they would not believe except if Allah wills. But most of them don't know.
Thus We have assigned an enemy to each prophet: devils among men and the jinn, who deceitfully inspire each other with embellished words. If your Lord had willed, they would not have done it; leave them with what they invent.
And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may lean toward them, and accept them, and perpetrate what they perpetrate.
Shall I seek any other judge than Allah, when it is He who has sent down to you this well-exposed Book? Those to whom We have given the Book know that it has come down with the truth from your Lord. Do not be among those who doubt.
And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in all truth and justice. No one can change His words. He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
And if you obey the majority of those who are on earth, they will lead you astray from the path of Allah: they only follow conjecture and only fabricate lies.
Verily your Lord knows best those who stray from His path, and He knows best those who are rightly guided.
So eat of what the name of Allah has been pronounced on if you believe in His verses (the Qur'an).
What do you have not to eat of what the name of Allah has been pronounced on? Whereas He has detailed to you what He has forbidden you, unless you are forced to resort to it. Many people lead astray, without knowing, by their passions. It is your Lord who knows the transgressors best.
Avoid sin, whether overt or hidden, (for) those who acquire sin will be rewarded according to what they have committed.
And do not eat of that on which the name of Allah has not been spoken, for that would be (assuredly) an evil. The devils inspire their allies to argue with you. If you obey them, you will certainly become associates.
Is he who was dead and whom We have brought back to life and to whom We have assigned a light by which he walks among the people, like one who is in darkness and cannot come out of it? Thus the disbelievers have been embellished with what they do.
Thus, We have placed in every city great criminals who hatch plots there. But they are only plotting against themselves and they are not aware of it.
And when proof comes to them, they say: "We will never believe until we have received a gift similar to that which was given to the messengers of Allah." Allah knows best where to place His message. Those who committed the crime will be reduced in the sight of Allah and will be punished severely for the tricks they were plotting.
And then, whoever Allah wants to guide, He opens his chest to Islam. And whoever He wants to go astray, He makes his chest narrow and embarrassed, as if he were striving to ascend to heaven. Thus Allah inflicts His punishment on those who do not believe.
This is the way of your Lord in all its righteousness. We have [indeed] detailed the signs (or verses) well to people who remember.
For them, the house of salvation with their Lord. And it is He who is their protector, for what they did (on earth).
And on the day when He gathers them all: "O community of the jinn, you have abused humans too much." And their allies among mankind will say, "O our Lord, we have profited by one another, and we have reached the time that You set for us." He will say to them: "Hell is your home, to remain there forever, unless Allah decides otherwise." Truly your Lord is Wise and All-Knowing.
And so We grant authority over others who are unrighteous because of what they have acquired.
O community of jinn and mankind, have not messengers come to you, chosen from among you, who have told you My signs and warned you of today's meeting? They'll say, "We're testifying against ourselves." The present life has deceived them; and they testified against themselves that they were disbelievers.
For your Lord does not unjustly destroy cities of which the people are not yet warned.
To each of the ranks (rewards) according to his works. Now your Lord is not inattentive to what they do.
Your Lord is Self-Sufficient, the Possessor of mercy. If He willed, He would destroy you and put in your place whomever He wills, just as He created you from the descendants of another people.
What you have been promised will (certainly) happen. And you are not in a position to reduce [Us] to impotence.
Say: "O my people! Continue to act according to your method; I too will act according to mine. Then you will know who will have a better fate in the Hereafter." Certainly, the unrighteous will never succeed.
And they assign to Allah a portion of what He Himself has created, in the way of crops and cattle, and they say: "This is Allah's - according to their claim! - and this to our deities." But what is for their gods does not come to Allah, while what is for Allah comes to their gods. How bad their judgment is!
And it is in this way that their deities have embellished the murder of their children with many associations, in order to ruin them and distort their religion in their eyes. But if Allah wills, they would not do it. Leave them, then, and what they invent.
And they said, "These are cattle and fields that are forbidden: only those we want will eat of them." "And these are beasts whose backs are taboo, and beasts on which they do not mention the name of Allah." Inventions against Him! He will reward them for what they invented as lies.
And they said, "What is in the belly of these beasts is reserved for the males of us, and forbidden to our wives." And if it's stillborn, they all participate. Soon He will reward them for their prescription, for He is Wise and All-Knowing.
They are certainly losers, those who have killed their children out of foolishness and ignorance, and those who have forbidden what Allah has given them of food, inventing lies against Allah. They have gone astray and are not guided.
It is He who created the gardens, trellis and non-trellises; as well as palm trees and crops with various crops; [as well as] the olive and the pomegranate, of similar and different species. Eat of their fruit, when they produce it; and pay the duties on the day of harvest. And do not waste, for He does not like wasters.
And (He created) among the cattle, some for transportation, and others for various uses; eat of what Allah has given you, and do not follow in the footsteps of the Devil, for he is an open enemy to you.
(He created) eight, in pairs: two for sheep, two for goats... say, "Is it the two males that He has forbidden or the two females, or what is in the wombs of the two females? Inform me of all knowledge, if you are truthful."
... two for camelids, two for cattle... Say: "Is it the two males that He has forbidden or the two females, or what is in the wombs of the two females? Or were you witnesses when Allah commanded you to do so?" Who is more unjust than the one who invents a lie against Allah to lead people astray without relying on any knowledge? Allah does not guide unrighteous people.
Say: "In what has been revealed to me, I find no forbidden for any eater to eat of it except the dead animal, or the blood that has been shed, or the flesh of a pig, for it is a filth, or that which has been sacrificed to anyone other than Allah out of wickedness." Whoever is compelled, but does not abuse or transgress, your Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
To the Jews We have forbidden every beast with a single nail. Of cattle and sheep We have forbidden them to fat, except what is on their backs, their entrails, or what is mixed with the bone. Thus We have punished them for their rebellion. And We are very truthful.
Then, if they call you a liar, then say: "Your Lord is the Holder of immense mercy, but His severity cannot be turned away from the criminals."
Those who have associated will say: "If Allah had willed, we would not have given Him associates, nor would our ancestors, nor would we have declared anything forbidden." Thus their predecessors called liars (the messengers) until they had tasted Our rigor. Say: "Have you any knowledge to produce for us? You only follow conjecture and only lie."
Say: The decisive argument belongs to Allah. If He had wanted to sure, He would have guided you all. (on the right path)
Say: "Bring your witnesses who will testify that Allah has forbidden this." If they then testify, then you do not bear witness with them and do not follow the passions of those who call Our signs lies and do not believe in the Hereafter, while they give equals to their Lord.
Say: "Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you: do not associate anything with Him; and be kind to your father and mother. Don't kill your children because of poverty. We feed you just like them. Do not approach turpitudes openly, or in secret. Kill only in justice the life that Allah has made sacred. This is what [Allah] has commanded you to do; perhaps you will understand.
And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the most beautiful way, until he has reached his majority. And give the right measure and weight, in all justice. We impose on a soul only according to its capacity. And when you speak, be fair even if it's a close relative. And fulfill your commitment to Allah. This is what He enjoins you to do. Maybe you'll remember.
"And this is My way in all its righteousness, so follow it; and do not walk in the paths that lead you away from His way." This is what He enjoins you to do. In this way you will attain piety.
Then We gave Moses the complete Book as a reward for the good he had done, and as a detailed account of all things, a guide and a mercy. Perhaps they would believe in their meeting with their Lord (on the Day of Judgment).
And here is a blessed Book (the Qur'an) which We have sent down - follow it therefore and be pious, that you may receive mercy -
so that you do not say, "The Book was sent down to only two peoples before us, and we were inattentive to study them.
Or you say, "If the Book had been sent down to us, we certainly would have been better guided than they were." Verily, you have come proof, guidance, and mercy from your Lord. Who is more unjust than the one who calls the verses of Allah lies and turns away from them? We will punish those who turn away from Our verses, with evil punishment, for turning away from them.
What are they waiting for? That the Angels come to them? Thy Lord come? Or that certain signs come from your Lord? In the day when certain signs of your Lord come, faith in Him will not benefit any soul who had not believed before or who had not gained any merit from his belief. Say: "Wait!" We are waiting, too.
Those who break up their religion and divide themselves into sects, for these you are not responsible for anything: their fate depends only on Allah. Then He will inform them of what they were doing.
Whoever comes with good will have ten times as much; and whoever comes with evil will be rewarded only by his equivalent. And we will do them no injustice.
Say: "My Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Abraham, the one who is subject only to Allah and who was not among the associates.
Say: "Verily, my Salah, my acts of devotion, my life and my death belong to Allah, the Lord of the Universe.
To Him no associate! And this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first to submit."
Say: "Would I seek any other Lord than Allah, when He is the Lord of all things? Everyone acquires [evil] only to his own detriment: no one will bear the burden (responsibility) of another. Then to your Lord will be your return and He will inform you of what you differ in.
It is He who has made you successors on earth and who has raised you in ranks one above the other, in order to test you in what He has given you. (Truly) your Lord is prompt in punishment, He is also Forgiving and Merciful.
Alif, Lâm, Mîm, Sâd.
It is a Book that has been sent down to you; let there be no embarrassment in your heart about him; so that by this you may warn, and (that it may be) a Reminder to the believers.
Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not follow any allies but Him. But you remember little.
How many cities We have destroyed! Now Our severity came to them during the night's rest or during their siesta.
Their invocation, when our severity came upon them, was limited to these words: "Certainly we were unjust."
We will question those to whom messengers were sent, and We will also question those who have been sent.
We will tell them with full knowledge (what they were doing) because We were not absent!
And the weigh-in on that day will be fair. So, the one whose good deeds will weigh heavily... these are the ones who will succeed!
And as for the one whose good deeds will weigh lightly... these are the ones who have caused the loss of their souls because they were unjust to Our teachings.
Verily, We have given you power on earth and We have assigned you sustenance on it. (But) you are very ungrateful!
We created you, then We gave you a form, then We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam." They prostrated themselves, with the exception of Iblis, who was not one of those who prostrated themselves.
[Allah] said: "What prevents you from prostrating yourself when I have commanded you to do so?" He replied, "I am better than he: You created me from fire, but You created him from clay."
[Allah] said: "Come down from here, You need not be puffed up with pride here. Come out, you are among the despised."
"Give me a delay," says (Satan), "until the day they are resurrected."
[Allah] says: "You are one of those to whom a delay is granted."
"Since You have misled me," says [Satan], "I will sit for them on Your right path,
then I will attack them from the front, from the rear, from their right and from their left. And for the most part, You won't find them grateful."
"Get out of there," says (Allah,) banished and rejected. Whoever follows you among them... of all of you, I will fill Hell."
"O Adam, dwell in Paradise, you and your wife; and eat of both of you, as you please; and do not come near this tree; otherwise you will be among the unjust."
Then the Devil, in order to make visible to them what was hidden from them - their nakedness - whispered to them, saying, "Your Lord has forbidden you this tree only to prevent you from becoming Angels or being immortal."
And he swore to them, "Truly, I am a good adviser to both of you."
Then he brought them down by deception. Then, when they had tasted of the tree, their nakedness became visible to them; and they both began to attach leaves of Paradise to it. And their Lord called to them, "Did I not forbid you this tree? And didn't I tell you that the Devil was an open enemy to you?"
Both of them said, "O our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. And if You do not forgive us and show us mercy, we will most certainly be among the losers."
"Come down," says [Allah], "you will be enemies of one another. And there will be for you on earth sojourn and enjoy for a time."
"There," says (Allah), "you will live, there you will die, and from there you will be brought out."
O children of Adam! We have sent down upon you a garment to hide your nakedness, as well as ornaments. - But the garment of piety is better - It is one of the signs (of the power) of Allah. So that they remember.
O children of Adam! Let not the Devil tempt you, as he brought your father and mother out of Paradise, tearing off their garments to make their nakedness visible to them. He sees you and his henchmen, from where you do not see them. We have appointed the devils as allies to those who do not believe,
and when they commit a slew, they say: "This is a custom bequeathed by our ancestors and prescribed by Allah." Say: "[No,] Allah does not command turpitude. Will you say against Allah what you do not know?"
Say: "My Lord has commanded righteousness. Let your prostration be exclusively for Him. And call upon Him, sincere in your worship. As He created you, you will return to Him."
He guides one part, while another part has merited the error because they have taken the devils as their allies instead of Allah, and they think that they are rightly guided.
O children of Adam, in every place of Salat wear your adornment (your clothes). And eat and drink; and do not commit excesses, for He [Allah] does not love those who commit excesses.
Say: "Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah, which He has produced for His servants, and good food?" Say: "They are for those who have faith in this life, and only for them on the Day of Resurrection." Thus We make the verses clear to the people who know.
Say: "My Lord has forbidden only the great sins, both overt and secret, as well as sin, unlawful aggression, and to associate with Allah what He has sent down no proof, and to say about Allah what you do not know."
For every community there is a term. When their term comes, they cannot delay it for an hour, nor can they hasten it.
O children of Adam! If messengers [chosen] from among you come to expound My signs to you, then those who acquire piety and reform will have no fear and will not be afflicted.
And those who treat Our signs as lies and depart from them with pride, are the people of the Fire and they will dwell there forever.
Who is more unrighteous than the one who invents a lie against Allah, or who treats His signs as lies? These will have the share that has been prescribed for them; until the time when Our Messengers [Our Angels] come to them to take away their souls, saying to them: "Where are those whom you invoked besides Allah?" – They will answer: "We can no longer find them". And they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.
"Enter into the Fire," [Allah] will say, "among the jinn and the men of the communities that have gone before you." Every time a community enters, it will curse the one that preceded it. Then, when all are there, the last batch will say of the first: "O our Lord! These are the ones who have led us astray: give them therefore a double punishment of fire." He will say: "To each double the amount, but you don't know".
And the first batch will say to the last: "But you have no advantage over us. Taste punishment for what you have acquired."
For those who treat Our teachings as lies and depart from them out of pride, the gates of heaven will not be opened to them, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel enters the eye of the needle. In this way We reward criminals.
Hell will serve as their bed, and as a blanket they will have veils of darkness. Thus do We reward the unjust.
And those who believe and do good deeds - We do not impose any burden on anyone except according to his ability - these will be the people of Paradise: they will dwell there forever.
And We will remove all the rancor from their breasts, and under them will flow the streams, and they will say: "Praise be to Allah who has guided us to this. We would not have been guided if Allah had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord have come with the truth." And they will be proclaimed, "This is the Paradise that has been given to you as an inheritance for what you did."
The people of Paradise will cry out to the people of Fire: "Verily, we have found true what our Lord promised us. Have you also found true what your Lord promised?" "Yes," they will say. Then a herald will announce in their midst: "May the curse of Allah be upon the unjust,
who obstructed the path of Allah, who wanted to make it crooked, and who did not believe in the Hereafter."
And between the two, there will be a wall, and on al-A'râf will be people who will recognize everyone by their characteristic features. And they will cry out to the people of Paradise, "Peace be upon you!" They did not enter it although they wanted to.
And when their eyes are turned to the people of the Fire, they will say; "O our Lord! Don't put us with the unjust people."
And the people of al-A'râf, calling certain men whom they will recognize by their characteristic features, will say: "You have not made any profit from all that you had amassed and from the pride with which you were puffed up!
Are these the ones you swore will not have mercy on Allah? - Enter Paradise! You will be free from all fear, and you will not be afflicted.
And the people of the Fire will cry out to the people of Paradise: "Pour water on us, or of what Allah has given you." "They will answer: Allah has forbidden them to the disbelievers."
The latter took their religion as a distraction and a game, and the life of this world deceived them. Today We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of their day here, and because they denied Our teachings.
We have indeed brought them a Book which We have detailed, in all knowledge, as a guide and mercy for people who believe.
Are they just waiting for fulfillment (of His threat and promises?)? On the day when its (true) fulfillment comes, those who previously forgot it will say, "The messengers of our Lord have come with the truth. Are there intercessors for us who can intercede on our behalf? Or can we be sent back [to earth], so that we can work differently from what we did before?" They have certainly created their own downfall; and what they invented has abandoned them.
Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then established Himself "istawâ" on the Throne. It covers the day with the night that pursues it without ceasing. (He created) the sun, the moon, and the stars, subject to His command. Creation and command belong to Him alone. All glory be to Allah, Lord of the Universe!
Call upon your Lord in all humility, reverence and discretion. Certainly, He does not like transgressors.
And do not sow corruption on the earth after it has been reformed. And call upon Him with fear and hope, for Allah's mercy is near to the doers.
It is He who sends the winds as a proclamation of His Mercy. Then, when they carry a heavy cloud, We direct it to a dead land, then We bring down the water, and then We bring out all kinds of fruit. In this way We will bring out the dead. Maybe you'll remember.
The good country, its vegetation grows with the grace of its Lord; as for the bad country, (its vegetation) comes out only insufficiently and with difficulty. In this way We spread the teachings for grateful people.
We sent Noah to his people. He said: "O my people, worship Allah. For you, there is no other god but Him. I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day."
The leaders of his people said, "We see you in manifest error."
He said, "O my people, there is no error in me; but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Universe.
I give you the messages of my Lord, and I give you sincere advice, and I know of Allah what you do not know.
Are you surprised that a reminder comes to you from your Lord through a man from you, that he may warn you, and that you may become godly and have mercy be granted to you?"
And they called him a liar. Now We saved him and those who were with him in the ark, and drowned those who called Our miracles lies. They were blind people, really.
And to the 'Aad, their brother Hud: "O my people," he said, "worship Allah. For you, there is no other god but Him. Do you not fear [him]?"
The leaders of his people who did not believe said, "Surely we see you in the midst of foolishness, and we think that you are among the liars."
He said, "O my people, there is no foolishness in me; but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Universe.
I am communicating to you the messages of my Lord, and I am a trustworthy adviser to you.
What! Are you surprised that a reminder comes to you from your Lord through a man from you, to warn you? And remember when He made you succeed Noah's people, and increased your body in height (and power). Well, remember the blessings of Allah so that you may succeed.
They said, "Have you come to us that we may worship Allah alone, and that we should forsake what our forefathers worshipped? Therefore bring forth what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful."
He said, "Behold, you are struck by your Lord with torment and anger. Are you going to argue with me about names that you and your ancestors have given, without Allah sending down any proof? Wait! I, too, am waiting with you.
Now We saved him and those who were with him out of mercy from Us, and We destroyed those who treated Our teachings as lies and who were not believers.
And to the Thamûd, their brother Sâlih: "O my people," he said, "worship Allah. For you, there is no other god but Him. Verily, a proof has come to you from your Lord: this is the she-camel of Allah, a sign for you. Let her eat in the land of Allah and do not harm her; otherwise a painful punishment will seize you.
And remember when He made you succeed the Aad and settled you on the earth. You have built palaces in its plains, and hewn the mountains into houses. So remember the bounties of Allah and do not spread corruption on the earth "like troublemakers."
The notables of his people, who were puffed up with pride, said to the oppressed, to those among them who had faith: "Do you know if Salih is sent from his Lord?" They said, "Yes, we believe in his message."
Those who were puffed up with pride said, "We certainly do not believe in what you have believed."
They killed the she-camel, disobeyed the command of their Lord, and said, "O Salih, bring to us what you threaten us with, if you are of the Messengers."
The cataclysm seizes them; and there they are lying lying in their dwellings.
Then he turned away from them and said, "O my people, I had communicated to you the message of my Lord and had counseled you sincerely. But you don't like sincere advisors!"
And Lot, when he said to his people, "Are you giving yourself up to this turpitude which none of the worlds has committed before you?
Certainly, you satisfy your carnal desires with men instead of women! You are indeed an outrageous people."
And in response, his people only said, "Expel them from your city. These are people who want to keep themselves pure!"
Now We have saved him and his family, except his wife, who was among the exterminated.
And We rained down on them. Look at what the end of the criminals was!
And to the Madyan, their brother Chu'aib: "O my people," he said, "worship Allah. For you, there is no other god but Him. A proof has come to you from your Lord. So give the full measure and weight and don't give people less than they are due. And do not commit corruption on the earth after its reform. It will be better for you if you are believers.
And do not stand on any path, threatening, preventing from the path of Allah the one who believes in Him and seeking to make this path crooked. Remember when you were few in number and He multiplied you in great numbers. And look at what happened to the troublemakers.
If some of you believed the message with which I was sent, and some of you did not, then wait until Allah judges among us, for He is the best of judges."
The leaders of his people, who were puffed up with pride, said, "We will certainly expel you from our city, O Chu'aib, you and those who have believed with you. Or that you go back to our religion." – He said, "Is it even when it disgusts us?"
Certainly, we would have forged a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah has saved us from it. It is not for us to go back unless Allah our Lord wills it. Our Lord embraces all things of His knowledge. It is in Allah that we place our trust. O our Lord, decide by the truth, between us and our people, for You are the best of judges."
And the elders of his people who did not believe, said: "If you follow Chu'aib, you will certainly lose."
Then the earthquake seizes them; and there they are stretched out, lying in their dwellings.
Those who called Chu'aib a liar (disappeared) as if they had never lived there. Those who called Chu'aib a liar were the losers.
He turned away from them and said, "O my people, I have well communicated to you the messages of my Lord and given you advice. How can I grieve over disbelievers?"
We have not sent any prophet into a city, except that We have taken its inhabitants afterwards out of adversity and distress to beg (forgiveness).
Then We changed their evil condition by substituting good for it, so that when they grew in numbers and wealth, they said, "Trouble and ease have come to our forefathers also." Well, We have seized them suddenly, without them realizing it.
If the inhabitants of the cities had believed and been pious, We would certainly have granted them blessings from heaven and earth. But they denied it, and so We seized them for what they had acquired.
Are the people of the cities sure that Our severe punishment will not come upon them at night, while they are asleep?
Are the people of the cities sure that Our severe punishment will not come upon them in the day, while they are enjoying themselves?
Are they safe from Allah's scheme? Only lost people feel safe from Allah's scheme.
Is it not proved to those who receive the earth as an inheritance from the previous peoples that, if We willed, We would strike them for their sins and seal their hearts, and they would hear nothing more?
These are the cities of which We tell you some of their news. [To these,] in truth, their messengers had brought them proofs, but they were not ready to accept what they had previously called a lie. This is how Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.
And We have found in most of them no respect for the commitment; but We have found most of them perverse.
Then, after [these messengers,] We sent Moses with Our miracles to Pharaoh and his notables. But they were unjust to Our signs. Consider, then, what was the end of the corrupters.
And Moses said, "O Pharaoh, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Universe,
I must only tell the truth about Allah. I have come to you with a proof from your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with me."
"If you have come with a miracle," says (Pharaoh), "bring it then, if you are of the truthful."
He threw down his staff, and behold, it was an obvious snake.
And he took out his hand and behold, it was white, to those who were looking.
The leaders of Pharaoh's people said, "This is indeed a seasoned magician.
He wants to expel you from your country." - "Then what do you command?"
They said, "Keep him and his brother waiting, and send gatherers into the cities,
which will bring you any wise magician.
And the magicians came to Pharaoh saying, "Will there really be a reward for us, if we are the overcomers?"
He said, "Yes, and you will certainly be among those who are near me."
They said, "O Moses, either you will throw (the first), or we will be the first to throw."
"Throw it away," he said. Then when they had thrown, they bewitched the eyes of the people and terrified them, and came with a powerful magic.
And We revealed to Moses, "Throw down your staff." And then he began to swallow up what they had made.
Thus the truth came to light and what they did was in vain.
Thus they were beaten and humiliated.
And the magicians fell down in prostration.
They said, "We believe in the Lord of the universe,
to the Lord of Moses and Aaron."
"Did you believe it before I allowed you?" said Pharaoh. It is indeed a stratagem that you have devised in the city, in order to make its inhabitants leave. You'll soon know...
I will cut off your opposite hand and leg, and then I will crucify you all."
They said, "Verily, we will return to our Lord.
You only take revenge on us because we believed in the proofs of our Lord, when they came to us. O our Lord! Pour out endurance on us and make us die completely submissive."
And the leaders of Pharaoh's people said, "Will you let Moses and his people make a mess on the earth, and he himself forsake you and your gods?" He said, "We are going to slaughter their sons and let their wives live. We'll get the better of them and dominate them."
Moses said to his people, "Ask Allah for help and be patient, for the land belongs to Allah. He makes them an heir whomever He wills among His servants. And the (happy) end will be to the pious."
They said, "We were persecuted before you came to us and after you came." He says, "Your Lord may destroy your enemy and give you the lieutenancy on earth, and then He will see how you will act."
We have tried Pharaoh's people by years of scarcity and by a decrease in fruit so that they might remember.
And when well-being came to them, they said, "It is due to us," and if any evil came upon them, they saw in Moses and those who were with him an ominous omen. Truly, their fate depends solely on Allah? But most of them don't know.
And they said, "No matter what miracle you bring to fascinate us, we will not believe in you."
And then We sent upon them the flood, the locusts, the lice (or the calender), the frogs, and the blood, as explicit signs. But they were puffed up with pride and remained a criminal people.
And when the chastisement came upon them, they said, "O Moses, call upon your Lord for us by virtue of the pledge He has given you. If you remove the punishment from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the children of Israel go with you."
And when We had removed the punishment from them until the appointed time which they were to reach, behold, they violated the engagement.
Then We took revenge on them; We drowned them in the waves, because they treated Our signs as lies and paid no attention to them.
And the people who were oppressed, We made them inherit the eastern and western lands of the land that We blessed. And the most beautiful promise of your Lord on the children of Israel is fulfilled as the price of their endurance. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people were doing, and what they were building.
And We have brought the Children of Israel across the Sea. They passed by a people attached to their idols and said, "O Moses, appoint us a deity like their gods." He said, "You are ignorant people.
The worship to which they devote themselves is obsolete; and everything they do is null and worthless."
He said: "Shall I seek for you any other god than Allah, when He has preferred you to all creatures?"
(Remember) the time when We saved you from Pharaoh's people who inflicted the worst punishment on you. They slaughtered your sons and let your wives live. This was a terrible trial on the part of your Lord.
And We gave Moses an appointment for thirty nights, and completed them with ten, so that the time appointed by his Lord ended at the end of forty nights. And Moses said to Aaron his brother, "Take my place among my people, and do good, and do not follow the path of the corrupters."
And when Moses came to Our appointment and his Lord spoke to him, he said, "O my Lord, show Yourself to me that I may see You." He said, "You shall not see Me; but look at the Mount: if it stands in its place, then you will see Me." But when his Lord manifested Himself on the Mount, He pulverized it, and Moses fell down in lightning. When he had recovered, he said, "Glory to You! To you I repent; and I am the first of the believers."
And (Allah) said: "O Moses, I have preferred you to all men, by My messages and by My word. Take therefore what I give you, and be among the grateful."
And We wrote for him on the tablets an exhortation concerning all things, and a detailed exposition of all things. "Take them therefore firmly and command your people to adopt the best of them. Soon I will show you the dwelling place of the wicked.
I will remove from My signs those who, without reason, puff themselves up with pride on earth. Even if they saw all the miracles, they wouldn't believe them. And if they see the right trail, they don't take it as a trail. But if they see the path of error, they take it as a path. It is because in truth they treat Our proofs as lies, and they paid no attention to them.
And those who deal with lies Our proofs as well as the encounter with the Hereafter, their works are in vain. Would they be rewarded otherwise than according to their deeds?"
And the people of Moses adopted after him a calf, made of their finery: a body that seemed to roar. Did they not see that he did not speak to them and that he did not guide them on any path? They adopted him [as a deity], and they were unrighteous.
And when they felt regret, and saw that they were indeed lost, they said, "If our Lord does not show us mercy and forgive us, we will certainly be among the losers."
And when Moses returned to his people, angry and saddened, he said, "You have done very badly during my absence! Did you want to hasten the command of your Lord?" He threw down the tablets and took his brother's head, drawing it to him: "O son of my mother," said (Aaron), "the people have treated me as weak, and they have come very near killing me. Do not therefore make enemies rejoice at my expense, nor assign me the company of unrighteous people."
And (Moses) said, "O my Lord, forgive me and my brother and bring us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful."
Those who took the calf (as a deity), soon will fall upon them from their Lord, anger, and degradation in this life. In this way, We reward the inventors (of idols).
Those who did evil deeds and then repented and believed... your Lord, after that, is surely Forgiving and Merciful.
And when Moses' anger had subsided, he took the tablets. In their text there was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord.
And Moses chose seventy men from his people to meet with Us. Then when they were seized by the earthquake, he said, "My Lord, if You had willed, You would have destroyed them first, and I with it. Are You going to destroy us for what foolish among us has done? This is only a trial of You, by which You lead astray whom You will, and guide whom You will. You are our Master. Forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the best of forgivers.
And prescribe for us good in this world as well as in the hereafter. Here we are back to You, repentant." And (Allah) said: "I will cause My punishment to reach whomever I will. And My mercy embraces all things. I will prescribe it to those who fear (Me), pay Zakat, and have faith in Our signs,
Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written (mentioned) in their homes in the Torah and the Gospel. He commands them what is proper, forbids them what is blameworthy, makes good things lawful for them, forbids them bad things, and takes away from them the burden and yokes that were upon them. Those who believe in him will support him, help him, and follow the light that has come down with him; These will be the winners.
Say: "O men! I am the Messenger of Allah to all of you, to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. No god but Him. He gives life and He gives death. So believe in Allah, in His Messenger, the illiterate Prophet who believes in Allah and His words. And follow him so that you may be well guided."
Among the people of Moses there is a community that guides (others) with the truth, and thereby exercises justice.
We divided them into twelve tribes, (twelve) communities. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked him for water, "Strike the rock with your staff." And now twelve springs gushed out. Each tribe knew its watering trough. We covered them with the shadow of the cloud, and sent down upon them manna and quails: "Eat of the good things which We have given you." And it was not Us that they wronged, but they harmed themselves.
And when it was said to them, "Dwell in this city and eat [of its produce] as you please, but say, 'Forgiveness [of our sins] and go in by the gate and bow down. We will forgive you your faults; and to the beneficent (of you,) We will grant more."
Then the unrighteous among them changed the word that was spoken to them into another. Then We sent punishment from heaven upon them for the misdeed they had committed.
And ask them about the city that looked out on the sea, when the Sabbath was transgressed there. That their fish came to them surfacing on their Sabbath day, and did not come to them on the day when it was not Sabbath. Thus We tested them for the evil they committed.
And when a community among them says: "Why do you exhort a people whom Allah is going to annihilate or punish with severe punishment?" They answered, "To relieve our responsibility to your Lord; and that perhaps they will become pious!"
Then, when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We saved those who had forbidden evil and seized with severe punishment the unrighteous for their wicked deeds.
Then, when they refused (out of pride) to give up what had been forbidden to them, We said to them, "Be abject monkeys."
And when your Lord announced that He would indeed send someone against them who would impose the worst punishment on them until the Day of Resurrection. Verily, your Lord is quick to punish, but He is also Forgiving and Merciful.
And We have divided them into communities on earth. There are good people among them, but there are some who are less so. We have tried them with good and evil, perhaps they would return (to the right path).
Then followed them by successors who inherited the Book, but who preferred what life on earth offers, saying: "We will have forgiveness." And if similar things are offered to them, they accept them. Had it not been made of them that they would not speak the truth about Allah? They had studied what is there. And the final resting place is better for those who practice godliness, - Will you not understand? -
And those who conform to the Book and perform Salat, [verily], We do not let the reward of those who mend their ways be lost.
And when We held up the Mount above them, as if it had been a parasol. They thought he was going to fall on them. "Hold fast to what We give you and remember its contents. Perhaps you will fear Allah."
And when your Lord took offspring from the loins of the sons of Adam and made them testify about themselves, "Am I not your Lord?" They answered, "Yes, we testify to it..." – so that you do not say on the Day of Resurrection, "Truly, we have not paid any attention to it."
or that you would have said (simply): "Our ancestors once gave partners to Allah, and we are their descendants, after them. Are You going to destroy us for what the impostors have done?"
And this is how We intelligently explain the signs. Maybe they will come back!
And tell them the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs and who departed from them. The Devil, therefore, dragged him into his retinue and he thus became one of the misguided.
And if We had willed, We would have brought him up by these same teachings, but he bowed down to the earth and followed his own passion. He is like a dog that pants if you attack him, and also pants if you leave him. This is the example of people who call Our Signs lies. Well, the story goes. Maybe they will think about it!
What a bad example are those who treat Our signs as lies, while it is themselves that they are wronging.
Whoever Allah guides, this is the rightly guided. And whoever He leads astray, these are the losers.
We have destined many jinn and men for Hell. They have hearts, but they don't understand. They have eyes, but they can't see. They have ears, but they can't hear. These are like cattle, even more misguided. Such are the careless.
To Allah belong the most beautiful names. Call upon Him by these names and let those who profane His names be rewarded: they will be rewarded for what they have done.
Among those whom We have created, there is a community that guides (others) according to the truth and through it exercises justice.
Those who treat Our teachings as lies, We will gradually lead them to their ruin in ways they do not know.
And I will give them a delay, for My stratagem is sound!
Have they not thought about it? There is no folly in their companion (Muhammad): he is only an explicit warner!
Have they not meditated on the kingdom of heaven and earth, and all things that Allah has created, and that their end may already be at hand? In what word will they believe after this?
Whoever Allah leads astray, there is no guide for him. And He leaves them in their transgression confused and hesitant.
They ask you about the Hour, "When will it come?" Say: "Only my Lord knows about it. He alone will manifest it in his own time. Heavy, it will be in the heavens and on the earth, and it will come to you only suddenly." They question you as if you were warned. Say: "Only Allah knows about it." But many people don't know.
Say: "I have no profit or damage for myself, except what Allah wills. And if I knew the Unknowable, I would have had abundant possessions and no evil would have touched me. I am, for people who believe, only a warner and a herald."
It is He who created you from one being from whom he took his wife, so that he might find tranquillity with her; and when he had cohabited with her, she conceived a slight pregnancy, with which she moved (easily). Then, when she found herself weighed down, they both invoked their Lord: "If You give us a healthy (child), we will certainly be among the grateful."
Then, when He had given them a healthy child, they both assigned to Allah partners in what He had given them. But Allah is far above the partners assigned to Him.
Do they assign as associates those who create nothing and who themselves are created,
and who can neither help them nor themselves?
If you call them to the straight path, they will not follow you. The result for you is the same whether you call them or keep silent.
Those whom you invoke besides Allah are servants like you. Therefore call upon them, and let them answer you, if you are truthful.
Do they have legs to walk? Do they have hands to strike? Do they have eyes to observe? Do they have ears to hear? Say: "Call upon your associates, and then cunning against me; and do not give me respite.
Verily, my Master, it is Allah who sent down the Book (the Qur'an). It is He who takes care of the righteous.
And those whom you call upon besides Him are not able to help you or themselves."
And if you call them to the straight path, they do not hear. You see them looking at you, (but) they don't see.
Accept what is reasonable offered you, command what is proper, and keep away from the ignorant.
And if the Devil ever incites you to do evil, seek refuge with Allah. For He hears, and knows everything.
Those who practice piety, when a suggestion of the Devil touches them, remember [Allah's punishment]: and behold, they become clairvoyants.
(As for the wicked), their evil partners drive them into aberration, and then they keep sinking.
When you don't bring them a miracle, they say, "Why don't you make it up?" Say: "I am only following what is revealed to me from my Lord. These [Quranic verses] are illuminating evidence from your Lord, a guide and a grace for people who believe.
And when one recites the Qur'an, listen carefully to him and observe silence, so that you may obtain mercy (from Allah).
And call upon your Lord in yourself, in humility and fear, in a low voice, morning and evening, and do not be of the careless.
Those who are with your Lord [the angels] do not disdain to worship Him. They glorify Him and bow down to Him.
They ask you about the loot. Say: "The spoils are Allah's and His Messenger's." Fear Allah, maintain harmony among yourselves, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are believers.
The true believers are those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned. And when His verses are recited to them, it increases their faith. And they put their trust in their Lord.
Those who perform Salat and spend [in the cause of Allah] what We have allotted to them.
These are truly believers: to them are (high) degrees with their Lord, as well as forgiveness and a generous endowment.
In the same way, it is in the name of truth that your Lord has brought you out of your dwelling, despite the repulsion of some of the believers.
They argue with you about the truth after it has clearly appeared; as if they were being pushed to death and they saw (it).
(Remember), when Allah promised you that one of the two bands will be yours. You wanted to take the one who was unarmed, while Allah wanted to make the truth triumph and destroy every last one of the disbelievers with His words.
so that He may make the truth triumph and the false destroyed, in spite of the repulsion of the criminals.
(And remember) the time when you implored your Lord's help and He immediately heard you: "I will help you with a thousand Angels pouring one after the other."
Allah did this only to bring good news and so that your hearts might be at peace with it. There is no victory except on the part of Allah. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
And when He enveloped you in sleep as a security from Him, and from heaven He sent water down upon you to cleanse you of it, to remove from you the defilement of the Devil, to strengthen your hearts and to strengthen your steps! [your steps].
And your Lord revealed to the angels, "I am with you: therefore strengthen the believers. I will strike fear into the hearts of the disbelievers. Strike above the necks and hit them on all the tips of your fingers.
This is because they have disobeyed Allah and His Messenger." And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger... Allah is certainly harsh in punishment!
That's (your fate); Taste it! And the disbelievers will be punished by the Fire.
O you who believe when you meet (the army) of the disbelievers on the march, do not turn your back on them.
Whoever turns his back on them on that day, unless it is as a battle tactic or to rally another group, he incurs the wrath of Allah and his refuge will be Hell. And what a bad destination!
It is not you who have killed them, but Allah has killed them. And when you threw a handful of ground, it was not you who threw it, but Allah threw it, and this was to test the believers with a great trial from Him. Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
There you go! Allah reduces the cunning of the disbelievers to nothing.
If you have implored Allah's arbitration, you now know [Allah's] ruling, and if you cease [disbelief and hostility against the Prophet..], it is better for you. But if you return, We will return, and your mass, even if it is numerous, will be of no use to you. For Allah is truly with the believers.
O you who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from Him when you hear Him (speak).
And don't be like those who say, "We have heard," when they do not hear.
The worst of the beasts in the sight of Allah are, [verily], the deaf and dumb who do not reason.
And if Allah had recognized any good in them, He would have made them hear. But even if He made them heard, they would [surely] turn their backs as they walked away.
O you who believe! Respond to Allah and the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you (true) life, and know that Allah stands between man and his heart, and to Him you will be gathered.
And fear a calamity that will not afflict exclusively the unrighteous among you. And know that Allah is harsh in punishment.
And remember when you were few, oppressed on earth, afraid of being taken away by people. He gave you refuge, strengthened you with His help, and bestowed good things on you so that you might be grateful.
O you who believe! Do not betray Allah and the Messenger. Don't knowingly betray the trust that has been placed in you?
And know that your property and your children are but a trial and that with Allah there is a great reward.
O you who believe! If you fear Allah, He will grant you the ability to discern (between good and evil), erase your wrongdoings, and forgive you. And Allah is the Possessor of great grace.
(And remember) the time when the disbelievers were plotting against you to imprison you or murder you or banish you. They plotted. but Allah has thwarted their plot, and Allah is the best in stratagems.
And when Our verses are recited to them, they say, "We have listened, verily! If we wanted, we would say the same thing, they are only legends of the ancients."
And when they said, "O Allah, if this is the truth from You, then rain stones on us from heaven, or bring upon us a painful punishment."
Allah is not such that He chastises them while you are in the midst of them. And Allah is not such that He chastises them when they ask for forgiveness.
What then do they have that Allah does not chastise them, while they reject (the believers) from the Holy Mosque, although they are not its guardians, for its guardians are only the righteous? But most of them don't know this.
And their prayer at the house is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: "Taste punishment for your disbelief."
Those who do not believe spend their wealth to lead (people) away from the path of Allah. Now, after having spent them, they will be a cause of regret to them. Then they will be defeated, and all those who do not believe will be gathered to Hell,
so that Allah may distinguish the evil from the good, and place the evil one on top of the other, to make a heap of them and cast it into Hell. These are the losers.
Tell those who do not believe that if they stop, they will be forgiven for what has happened. And if they reoffend, (they shall be punished); following the example of (their) predecessors.
And fight them until there is no longer any association, and the religion is entirely Allah's. Then, if they cease (they will be forgiven, for) Allah observes what they do.
And if they turn their backs, then know that Allah is your Master. What an excellent Master and what an excellent Protector!
And know that of all the booty you have collected, the fifth belongs to Allah, to the Messenger, to his next relatives, to the orphans, to the poor, and to the travelers, if you believe in Allah and in what We have sent down upon Our servant on the Day of Discernment, the day on which the two groups met,  and Allah is Omnipotent.
You were on the nearest slope, and they (the enemies) were on the farthest slope, while the caravan was lower than you. If you had made an appointment, you would have missed it (frightened by the number of the enemy). But Allah had to fulfill a command that was to be carried out, so that, on proof, he who was (to) perish, and live, on proof, the one who (was) to live. And Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
In a dream, Allah showed you that they were few! For if He had shown you many of them, you would certainly have relented, and you would certainly have quarrelled about the matter. But Allah has preserved you from it. He knows the contents of hearts.
And also, at the time of the meeting, He showed you that they were few in Your eyes, just as He made you appear to their eyes few so that Allah could complete a command that had to be carried out. It is to Allah that things are brought back.
O you who believe! When you meet a troop, be firm, and invoke Allah a lot in order to succeed.
And obey Allah and His Messenger; and do not quarrel, or you will give way and lose your strength. And be enduring, for Allah is with those who endure.
And do not be like those who went out of their homes to reject the truth and with public ostentation, obstructing the way of Allah. And Allah knows what they do.
And when the Devil had embellished their deeds and said, "No one among mankind can dominate you today, and I am your support." But when the two groups were in sight of each other, he turned on both heels and said, "I disown you. I see what you do not see; I fear Allah, and Allah is harsh in punishment."
(And remember), when the hypocrites and those with a heart trouble [whose faith is doubtful] said, "These people, their religion deceives them." But whoever puts his trust in Allah (will be victorious)... for Allah is Mighty and Wise.
If you only saw when the angels snatched the souls of the disbelievers! They struck them on their faces and behinds, (saying, "Taste the punishment of the Fire.
This (the punishment), for what your hands have done." And Allah is not unjust to slaves.
The same was true of Pharaoh's people and those who before them did not believe in the signs (teachings) of Allah. Allah seizes them for their sins. Verily, Allah is strong and severe in punishment.
This is because Allah does not change a blessing that He has bestowed on a people before they change what is in themselves. And Allah is, Hearer and All-Knowing.
So it was with Pharaoh's people and those who before them had called the signs (teachings) of their Lord lies. We have destroyed them for their sins. And We have drowned Pharaoh's people. For they were all unrighteous.
The worst beasts in the sight of Allah are those who have been unfaithful (in the past) and therefore do not believe (at present),
the same ones with whom you have made a pact and who break it every time, without any fear [of Allah].
Therefore, if you subdue them in war, inflict exemplary punishment on them so that those behind them will be frightened. So that they remember.
And if you really fear betrayal by a people, then denounce the pact (which you have made with it) in a frank and fair way, because Allah does not like traitors.
Let not the disbelievers think that they have escaped Us. No, they will never be able to stop Us (from catching up with them at any time).
And prepare against them all that you can in the way of strength and equipped, in order to frighten the enemy of Allah and your own, and others whom you do not know besides these, but whom Allah knows. And whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.
And if they incline to peace, incline to it (you also) and put your trust in Allah, for He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
And if they want to deceive you, then Allah will be sufficient for you. It is He who has sustained you with His help, as well as with the believers.
He has united their hearts (by faith). Had you spent all that is on earth, you would not have been able to unite their hearts; but Allah has united them, for He is Mighty and Wise.
O Prophet, Allah and those of the believers who follow you are sufficient for you.
O Prophet, incite the believers to battle. If there are twenty of you who endure, they will overcome two hundred; And if there are a hundred, they will overcome a thousand disbelievers, for they are really people who do not understand.
Now, Allah has lightened your task, knowing that there is weakness in you. If there are a hundred of you who have endured, they will overcome two hundred; and if there are a thousand, they will overcome two thousand, by the grace of Allah. And Allah is with those who endure.
A prophet should not take prisoners until he has prevailed [put the disbelievers out of action] on the earth. You want the goods of this world, while Allah wants the Hereafter. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Had it not been for a prior prescription from Allah, a great punishment would have come upon you for what you have taken. [of the ransom]
Eat therefore of what is yours as booty, as long as it is lawful and pure. And fear Allah, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O Prophet, say to the captives in your hands: "If Allah knows that there is any good in your hearts, He will give you better than what has been taken from you and will forgive you. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And if they want to betray you, they have already betrayed Allah [by disbelief]; but He has given a hold on them [on the day of Badr]. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
Those who believed, emigrated and struggled with their property and their lives in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them refuge and help, these are allies of one another. As for those who believed and did not emigrate, you will not be bound to them until they emigrate. And if they ask you for help in the name of religion, then it is up to you to help them, but not against a people to whom you are bound by a pact. And Allah observes what you do.
And those who did not believe are allies of one another. If you do not do this [by severing ties with the infidels], there will be discord on earth and great disorder.
And those who believed, emigrated and struggled in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave them refuge and help, these are the true believers: to them forgiveness and a generous reward.
And those who after that believed and emigrated and struggled with you, these are yours. However, those who are related have priority over each other, according to the Book of Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing.
Disavowal on the part of Allah and His Messenger with regard to the associates with whom you have made a pact:
Travel the earth for four months; and know that you will not reduce Allah to impotence, and that Allah covers the disbelievers with shame."
And proclamation to the people, from Allah and His Messenger, on the Day of the Great Hajj, that Allah and His Messenger disavow the associates. If you repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, know that you will not reduce Allah to helplessness. And announces a painful punishment to those who do not believe.
Except for the partners with whom you made a covenant, and then they did not fail you in anything, and did not support anyone against you: fully abide by the covenant made with them until the agreed term. Allah loves the pious.
After the holy months expire, kill the Associates wherever you find them. Capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them in any ambush. If they then repent, perform Salah and pay Zakat, then let them go, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And if one of the associates asks you for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah, and then bring him to his place of safety. Because these are people who don't know.
How can there be a covenant for the members of the association that Allah and His Messenger accepts? Except for those with whom you have made a pact near the Holy Mosque. As long as they are right to you, be right to them. For Allah loves the pious.
How so! When they triumph over you, they respect neither kinship nor pact made with you. They satisfy you with their mouths, while their hearts refuse; and most of them are perverts.
They barter the verses of Allah (the Koran) at a low price and obstruct His path. What they are doing is very bad!
They do not respect any kinship or pact made with regard to a believer. And these are the transgressors.
But if they repent, perform Salah, and pay Zakat, they will become your brothers in religion. We explain the verses intelligibly to people who know.
And if, after the covenant, they violate their oaths and attack your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief - for they do not keep any oath - perhaps they will cease?
Will you not fight against people who have broken their oaths, who have wanted to banish the Messenger and then they are the ones who attacked you first? Did you fear them? Allah is more worthy of your fear if you are believers.
Fight them. Allah, through your hands, will punish them, cover them with shame, give you victory over them, and heal the breasts of a believing people.
And he will remove the wrath from their hearts. Allah welcomes repentance from whomever He wills. Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
Do you think that you will be left behind, but Allah has not yet distinguished those of you who have struggled and have not sought allies besides Allah, His Messenger and the believers? And Allah is Fully Aware of what you do.
It is not for the associators to populate the mosques of Allah, since they are testifying against themselves to their disbelief. These are those whose works are in vain; and in the Fire they will remain forever.
Only those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, perform Salah, pay Zakat, and fear only Allah will populate the mosques of Allah. It may be that these are among the rightly guided.
Will you make it a duty to give the pilgrims something to drink and to maintain the Sacred Mosque (duties) comparable to the merit of one who believes in Allah and the Last Day and strives in the cause of Allah? They are not equal with Allah, and Allah does not guide the unjust.
Those who believed, who emigrated and who struggled with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah, have the highest rank with Allah... and they are the victors.
Their Lord proclaims to them mercy and pleasure from Him, and of the Gardens where there will be a permanent delight for them
where they will dwell forever. Verily, there is a great reward with Allah.
O you who believe! Do not take your fathers and brothers as allies if they prefer disbelief to faith. And whoever among you takes them as allies... these are the unjust.
Say: "If your fathers, your children, your brothers, your wives, your clans, the wealth you earn, the trade that you fear will decline, and the dwellings that are pleasing to you, are dearer to you than Allah His Messenger and the struggle in the cause of Allah, then wait for Allah to send for His command. And Allah does not guide evil people."
Allah has already helped you in many places. And [remember] the day of Hunayn, when you were proud of your great numbers and it was of no use to you. The earth, in spite of its extent, became very narrow for you; then you turned your backs on the fugitives.
Then Allah sent down His peace of Allah upon His Messenger and upon the believers. He sent down troops (angels) whom you did not see, and punished those who disbelieved. This is the reward for the disbelievers.
After that, Allah will receive repentance from whomever He wills, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who believe! The associates are nothing but impurity: let them not go near the Holy Mosque after this year. And if you fear a shortage, Allah will enrich you, if He wills, by His grace. For Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
Fight those who do not believe in Allah or the Last Day, who do not forbid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, and who do not profess the religion of truth, among those who have received the Book, until they pay the poll tax with their own hands, after having humbled themselves.
The Jews say, "Uzayr is the son of Allah," and the Christians say, "Christ is the son of Allah." This is their word from their mouths. They imitate the words of the disbelievers before them. May Allah destroy them! How do they deviate (from the truth)?
They took their rabbis and monks, as well as Christ son of Mary, as Lords besides Allah, while they were commanded only to worship one God. No god but Him! Glory be to Him! He is above what they associate with Him.
They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, while Allah only wants to complete His light, however much the disbelievers may be repulsed by it.
It is He who sent His messenger with the right guidance and the religion of truth, that it might triumph over all other religions, no matter how much the associates may be repulsed by them.
O you who believe! Many rabbis and monks devour people's property illegally and obstruct [their] path of Allah. To those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend them in the cause of Allah, announce a painful punishment,
on the day when (these treasures) are brought to incandescence in the fire of Hell and are cauterized by it, forehead, flanks, and backs: this is what you have hoarded for yourselves. Taste of what you have been hoarding."
The number of months with Allah is twelve [months], according to Allah's prescription, on the day on which He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are sacred: such is the right religion. [During these months], do not harm yourselves. Fight the associators without exception, as they fight you without exception. And know that Allah is with the righteous.
Postponing from one holy month to another is an increase in disbelief. In this way, the disbelievers are led astray: one year they make it profane, and one year they make it sacred, in order to adjust the number of months that Allah has made sacred. In this way they make profane what Allah has made sacred. Their misdeeds are embellished with them. And Allah does not guide people who disbelieve.
O you who believe! What have you got? When you were told, "Pursue the cause of Allah," you weighed down on the earth. Is the present life more pleasing to you than the hereafter? - Now, the enjoyment of the present life will be but a small thing compared to the hereafter!
If you do not go into battle, He will punish you with a painful punishment and replace you with another people. You will not harm Him in any way. And Allah is Omnipotent.
If you don't help him... Allah has already helped him, when those who had disbelieved had banished him, the second of two. When they were in the cave and he said to his companion, "Do not grieve, for Allah is with us." Allah then sent down upon Him His serenity and supported him with soldiers (angels) whom you did not see, and thus He lowered the word of the disbelievers, while the word of Allah prevailed. And Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Light or heavy, go into battle, and fight with your property and your people in the cause of Allah. This is better for you, if you knew.
If it had been an easy profit or a short journey, they would have followed you; but the distance seemed long to them. And they will swear by Allah: "If we had been able, we would have gone out with you." They lose themselves. And Allah knows that they are lying.
May Allah forgive you! Why did you give them permission before you could distinguish those who spoke the truth and recognize the liars?
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask your permission to fight with their property and their persons. And Allah knows the righteous well.
Ask permission only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and whose hearts are filled with doubt. They only hesitate in their uncertainty.
And if they had wanted to go (to battle), they would have made preparations for him. But their departure was repugnant to Allah; He made them lazy. And it was said to them, "Stay with those who remain."
If they had gone out with you, they would only have increased your trouble and thrown your ranks into dissension, seeking to create discord among you. And there are some of you who are listening to them. And Allah knows well the wrongdoers.
They have previously sought to sow discord (in your ranks) and to confuse your affairs until the truth comes and the command of Allah triumphs, despite their hostility.
Among them there are those who say, "Give me permission (to stay) and do not put me in temptation." But it is indeed into temptation that they have fallen; Hell is all around the disbelievers.
When happiness reaches you, it distresses them. And when something bad befalls you, they say: "Fortunately we had taken our precautions in advance." And they turn away while exulting.
Say: "Nothing will come to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our Protector. It is in Allah that believers must put their trust."
Say: "What are you waiting for us, if not one of the two best things? Whereas what we expect for you is that Allah inflicts punishment on you from Him or through our hands. Wait! We are also waiting, with you."
Say: "Spend willingly or unwillingly: it will never be accepted of you, for you are perverse people."
What prevents their gifts from being accepted is the fact that they have not believed in Allah and His Messenger, that they go to Salat only lazily, and that they spend (on good deeds) only reluctantly.
Let not their possessions and their children marvel at you! Allah only wants to punish them in this life, and to make the soul painfully disbelieved.
And they (the hypocrites) swear by Allah that they are truly of you; when they are not. But they are fearful people.
If they found a refuge, caves or an underground passage, they would turn there and rush into it at full speed.
There are some among them who criticize you about the Sadaqats: if they are given any, they are pleased; but if they are not given any, they are full of resentment.
If they had been satisfied with what Allah had given them and His Messenger and said, "Allah is sufficient for us. Soon Allah will bestow His favor on us as well as His Messenger... It is to Allah that all our desire goes."
Sadaqats are intended only for the poor, the destitute, those who work in them, those whose hearts are to be won (to Islam), freedom from yokes, those who are heavily indebted, in the cause of Allah, and for the traveler (in distress). This is a decree of Allah! And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And there are among them those who harm the Prophet and say, "He is all ear." - Say: "An ear for your good. He believes in Allah and trusts the believers, and he is a mercy to those of you who believe. And those who harm the Messenger of Allah will have a painful punishment."
They swear to you by Allah to satisfy you. Whereas Allah - as well as His Messenger - has more right for them to satisfy Him, if they are truly believers.
Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger will have the fire of Hell to dwell there forever? And here is the immense opprobrium.
The hypocrites fear that a Surah will be sent down upon them revealing what is in their hearts. Say: "Mock! Allah will bring out what you take the precaution (to hide)."
And if you asked them, they'd most certainly say, "Really, we were just chatting and playing." Say: "Are you mocking Allah and His verses (the Qur'an) and His Messenger?"
Don't apologize: you did reject faith after believing. If We pardon one part of your people, We will punish another for having been criminals.
Hypocrites, men and women, belong to each other. They command what is blameworthy, forbid what is proper, and fold up their hands (in avarice). They have forgotten Allah and He has forgotten them. In truth, the hypocrites are the perverts.
To the hypocrites, men and women, and to the disbelievers, Allah has promised the fire of Hell to dwell there forever. That's enough for them. Allah has cursed them. And for them, there will be permanent punishment.
The same was true of those who came before you: they were stronger than you, richer, and had more children. They enjoyed their lot [in this world], and you enjoyed your lot as your predecessors enjoyed their lot. And you argued at random like what they had discussed. These will see their works destroyed in this world and in the next, and they are the losers.
Has not the history of those who came before them come down to them: the people of Noah, the 'Aad, the Tamûd, the Abraham, the people of Midyan, and the overthrown cities? Their messengers had brought them clear proofs. It was not Allah who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.
Believers are allies of one another. They command what is proper, forbid what is blameworthy, perform the 'alat, pay zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. These are the ones to whom Allah will have mercy, for Allah is Mighty and Wise.
To the believers, Allah has promised Gardens under which streams flow, so that they may dwell in them forever, and excellent mansions, in the Gardens of Eden. And Allah's satisfaction is even greater, and this is the enormous success.
O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and hypocrites, and be harsh with them; Hell will be their refuge, and what a bad destination!
They swear by Allah that they did not say (what they said), when in truth they spoke the word of disbelief and they rejected the faith after they were Muslims. They projected what they could not accomplish. But they have nothing to reproach except that Allah - as well as His Messenger - has enriched them by His grace. If they repented, it would be better for them. And if they turn their backs, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment, both here and hereafter; and they will have no ally or helper on earth.
And among them there are some who have made a pledge to Allah: "If He gives us His grace, we will certainly pay Zakat and be among the righteous."
But when He gave them His grace, they were miserly and turned their backs in an about-face.
So He has stirred up hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they meet Him, for breaking what they promised Allah and for lying.
Do they not know that Allah knows their secret and their confidential conversations, and that Allah knows perfectly well the unknowable?
Those who direct their slanders against believers who give voluntary alms and against those who find only their feeble means (to offer), and then they mock them. May Allah mock them. And they will have a painful punishment.
Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or whether you do not ask for it - and if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times - Allah will not forgive them. This is because they did not believe in Allah and His Messenger and Allah does not guide evil people.
Those who were left behind rejoiced that they could stay at home behind the Messenger of Allah, they were loath to fight with their property and their persons in the cause of Allah, and said: "Do not go to battle in this heat!" Say: "The fire of Hell is more intense in heat."
Let them laugh a little and cry a lot as a reward for what they have acquired.
If Allah brings you back to a group of these (people), and they ask your permission to go to battle, then say: "You will never go out with me again, and you will never fight enemies with me again. You were happier staying at home the first time; therefore remain at home in the company of those who stand in the rear."
And never do Salat on one of them who dies, and do not stand by his grave, because they did not believe in Allah and His Messenger, and they died while being perverse.
And let neither their possessions nor their children amaze you! Allah only wants to punish them here below, and that they give up the ghost with difficulty as disbelievers.
And when a Surah is revealed: "Believe in Allah and fight in the company of His Messenger," the people who have all the means (to fight) among them ask you to exempt them (from the fight), and say: "Leave us with those who remain."
It pleases them (after the departure of the combatants) to remain with those who have remained in the rear. Their hearts have been sealed and they don't understand anything.
But the Messenger and those who believed with him struggled with their possessions and their persons. They will have the right things and they will succeed.
Allah has prepared for them Gardens under which streams flow, so that they may dwell in them forever. This is a huge success!
And among the Bedouins, some came to ask to be excused (from fighting). And those who lied to Allah and His Messenger stayed at home. A painful punishment will afflict the disbelievers among them.
There is no reproach against the weak, nor against the sick, nor on those who cannot find anything to spend (for the sake of Allah), if they are sincere towards Allah and His Messenger. No reproach against benefactors. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Nor do you reproach those who came to you to provide them with a mount, and to whom you said, "I cannot find a mount for you." They turned back with tears in their eyes, sad that they couldn't find anything to spend.
There is no way (of reproach to), truly, except against those who ask to be exempted, even though they are rich. They like to stay with those who have remained behind. And Allah has sealed their hearts and they do not know.
They apologize to you when you come back to them. Say: "Don't apologize: we don't believe you. Allah has already informed us of your news. And Allah will see your work, as well as His Messenger. Then you will be brought back to the One who knows the invisible and the visible well, and then He will inform you of what you were doing.
They will swear oaths to you by Allah, when you return to them, so that you may pass away. Turn away from them. They are a defilement and their refuge is Hell, in retribution for what they acquired.
They make oaths to you to be acceptable to you, even if you accept them, Allah does not accept evil people.
The Bedouins are more hardened in their impiety and hypocrisy, and the most inclined to disregard the precepts that Allah revealed to His Messenger. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
Among the Bedouins, some take their expense (in alms or in war) as an expensive burden, and expect a reversal of fortune for you. May misfortune fall upon them! Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
Another of the Bedouins believes in Allah and the Last Day and takes what he spends as a means of getting closer to Allah and in order to benefit from the supplications of the Messenger. It is truly for them (a way) to draw closer (to Allah) and Allah will admit them into His mercy. For Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The very first [believers] among the Émigrés and Auxiliaries and those who followed them in good behavior, Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which streams flow, and they will dwell there forever. This is a huge success!
And among the Bedouins around you, there are hypocrites, as well as some of the inhabitants of Medina. They persist in hypocrisy. You do not know them, but We know them. We will chastise them twice and then they will be brought back to a huge punishment.
Others have acknowledged their sins, they have mixed good deeds with bad ones. It may be that Allah will welcome their repentance. For Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Take from their possessions a Sadaqah by which you purify and bless them, and pray for them. Your prayer is a peace of mind for them. And Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
Do they not know that it is Allah who receives the repentance of His servants, and who receives the Sadaqat, and that Allah is the One who welcomes repentance and the Merciful?
And say: "Work, for Allah will see your work, as well as His Messenger and the believers, and you will be brought back to Him who knows well the invisible and the visible. Then He will inform you of what you were doing."
And others are left waiting for Allah's decision, either to punish them or to forgive them. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
Those who have built a mosque to make it a motive for rivalry, ungodliness and division among the believers, who prepare it for the one who previously fought against Allah and His Messenger and swear, saying: "We wanted only good." Allah testifies that they are lying.
Never stand in (this mosque). For a mosque founded from the first day on piety is more worthy for you to stand in it. There are people who like to purify themselves, and Allah loves those who purify themselves.
Which one is more deserving? Is it the one who founded his building on the piety and pleasure of Allah, or the one who placed the foundations of his building on the edge of a crumbling cliff and collapsed with him in the fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide unrighteous people.
The building they have built will always be a source of doubt in their hearts, until their hearts are torn apart. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
Verily, Allah bought believers, their persons and their possessions in exchange for Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah: they kill, and they are killed. It is an authentic promise that He has made upon Himself in the Torah, the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is more faithful than Allah to his commitment? So rejoice in the exchange you have made: And this is the great success.
They are those who repent, worship, praise, walk the earth (or fast), bow, bow, prostrate, command what is proper and forbid what is blameworthy, and observe the laws of Allah... and give good news to the believers.
It is not for the Prophet and the believers to beg forgiveness for the associates, even if they are relatives, when it has become clear to them that they are the people of Hell.
Abraham asked forgiveness for his father only because of a promise he had made to him. But as soon as it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he disowned him. Abraham was certainly full of care and forgiving.
Allah is not such as to lead a people astray after He has guided them, until He has made it clear to them what they should avoid. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and He gives death. And there is no ally or protector for you besides Allah.
Allah welcomed the repentance of the Prophet, that of the Emigrants and Auxiliaries who followed him at a difficult time, after the hearts of a group of them were on the verge of deviating. Then He welcomed their repentance, for He is Compassionate and Merciful to them.
And [He accepted repentance] of the three who had remained behind, so that, vast as it was, the earth seemed small to them; they felt cramped, in their own person, and they thought that there was no other refuge from Allah than with Him. Then He accepted their repentance so that they might return, for Allah is the Merciful One who welcomes repentance.
O you who believe! Fear Allah and be with the truthful.
It is not for the people of Medina, nor for the Bedouins who are around them, to lag far behind the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer their own life to his. For they will not be thirsty, weary, or hungry in the cause of Allah, nor will they tread any land and provoke the anger of the infidels, nor will they gain any advantage over an enemy, unless a good deed is written for them. Verily, Allah does not let the reward of the benefactors be lost.
They shall not bear any expense, small or large, shall not pass through any valley, and shall not be recorded in their credit, so that Allah may reward them for the best of what they did.
Believers do not have to leave all their homes. Why should not a few men from each clan come to be instructed in religion, so that on their return they can warn their people so that they may be on their guard?
O you who believe! Fight against those who disbelieve who are near you; and that they find hardness in you. And know that Allah is with the righteous.
And when a Surah is revealed, there is one among them who says, "Which of you is it that it increases in faith?" As for the believers, it certainly increases their faith, and they rejoice in it.
But as for those whose hearts are sick, it adds a defilement to their defilement, and they die in disbelief.
Do they not see that every year they are tried once or twice? Despite this, they do not repent or remember.
And when a Surah is revealed, they look at each other [and say]: "Does anyone see you?" Then they turn away. May Allah turn away their hearts, since they are people who do not understand anything.
Verily, a Messenger from among you has come to you, who is burdened by the difficulties you are undergoing, who is full of concern for you, who is compassionate and merciful to the believers.
So, if they turn away, say: "Allah is sufficient for me. There is no god but Him. In Him I place my trust; and He is the Lord of the immense Throne."
Alif, Lâm, Râ. These are the verses of the Book full of wisdom.
Is it any wonder to the people that We have revealed to one of them, "Warn the people, and preach the good news to the believers that they have a deserved presence with their Lord [for their former loyalty]? The disbelievers then said, "This one is certainly an obvious magician."
Your Lord is, Allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then established Himself "Istawa" on the Throne, administering all things. There is no intercessor except with His permission. This is Allah your Lord. Worship Him, then. Don't you think?
To Him you will all return, this is the promise of Allah in all truth. It is He who makes the creation for the first time and then remakes it (by resurrecting it) in order to reward in all fairness those who have believed and done good deeds. As for those who did not believe, they will have a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment because of their disbelief.
It is He who has made the sun a brightness and the moon a light, and He has determined the phases of them so that you may know the number of years and the calculation. Allah has created this only in all truth. He exposes the signs for people who are gifted with knowledge.
In the alternation of night and day, and also in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs, indeed, for people who fear (Allah).
Those who do not hope for Our meeting, who are satisfied with the present life and feel safe in it, and those who are inattentive to Our signs [or verses],
their refuge will be Fire, for what they acquired.
Those who believe and do good deeds, their Lord will guide them because of their faith. At their feet the streams will flow in the Gardens of Earthly Delights.
There, their supplication will be "Glory to You, O Allah," and their greeting: "Salam," [Peace!], and the end of their supplication: "Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Universe."
And if Allah hastened people's misfortune with as much haste as they seek happiness, the end of their lives would have been decreed. But We leave those who do not hope for Our meeting confused and hesitant in their transgression.
And when misfortune befalls man, he calls upon Us, lying on his side, sitting, or standing. And when We deliver him from his misfortune, he goes away as if he had not implored Us for an evil that has befallen him. Thus were their actions embellished by the outrageous.
We have destroyed the generations before you when they were unrighteous when their messengers had brought them proofs. However, they were not willing to believe. This is how We reward criminal people.
Then we made you successors on earth after them, to see how you would act.
And when Our verses are recited to them in all clarity, those who do not expect us to meet say: "Bring a Qur'an other than this" or "Change it." Say: "It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I am only following what is revealed to me. I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a terrible day."
Say: "If Allah had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. Before that, I remained among you for a whole age. Are you not reasoning?"
Who is more unjust than the one who invents a lie against Allah, or who treats His verses (the Qur'an) as lies? Criminals really don't succeed.
They worship instead of Allah that which can neither harm nor benefit them, and say: "These are our intercessors with Allah." Say: "Will you inform Allah of what He does not know in the heavens and on the earth?" Purity to Him, He is Very High above what They associate with Him!
The people were (originally) one community. Then they diverged. And if it were not for the prior decision of your Lord, the disputes between them would have been settled.
And they say, "Why is not a miracle of his Lord sent down upon him?" Then say: "The unknowable belongs only to Allah. Wait, then; I will be with you among those who wait.
And when We give people a taste of mercy after a misfortune has befallen them, behold, they are denigrating Our verses. Say: "Allah is quicker to repress (those who denigrate His verses)." For Our angels record your denigrations.
It is He who makes you go on land and sea, when you are in a boat. [These boats] carried them away, thanks to a good wind. They rejoiced until the moment when, assailed by a rushing wind, assailed on all sides by the waves, judging themselves enveloped [by death], they prayed to Allah, worshipping Him [and saying]: "Verily, if You save us from this, we will be among the grateful."
When He has saved them, there they are, on earth, transgressing unjustly. O people! Your transgression will fall only on yourselves. It is a temporary enjoyment of the present life. Then you will return to Us, and then We will remind you of what you were doing.
The present life is like water that We send down from heaven and that mixes with the vegetation of the earth on which men and beasts feed. Then, when the earth takes on its adornment and becomes more beautiful, and its inhabitants think that it is entirely at their disposal, Our Order comes to it, night or day, and it is then that We will make it all harvested, as if it had not flourished the day before. Thus We set forth the proofs for thinking people.
Allah calls to the abode of peace and guides whomever He wills to a straight path.
To those who do good is reserved the best (reward) and even more. No blackening smoke, no degradation will cover their faces. These are the people of Paradise, where they will dwell forever.
And those who have committed evil deeds, the reward for an evil deed will be the equivalent. A degradation will cover them, - no protector for them against Allah - as if their faces were covered with shreds of darkness at night. These are the people of the Fire where they will dwell forever.
(And remember) the day when We will gather them all. Then We will say to those who have given [Allah] associates: "In your place, you and your associates." We will separate them from each other and their associates will say, "It is not us that you worship."
Allah is sufficient as a witness between us and you. In truth, we were indifferent to your adoration."
There every soul will experience (the consequences of) what it has previously accomplished. And they will be brought back to Allah their true Master; and their inventions (idols) will depart from them.
Say: "Who gives you food from heaven and earth? Who has hearing and sight, and who brings the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living, and who administers everything?" They will say, "Allah." Then say, "Do you not fear Him?"
This is Allah, your true Lord. Beyond the truth, what is there but delusion? How can you turn away?"
Thus the word of your Lord against the wicked has been fulfilled: "They will not believe."
Say: "Of your associates, who gives life by a first creation and gives it again [after death]?" Say: "Allah [alone] gives life through a first creation and gives it again. How can you deviate from [worshiping Allah]?
Say: "Is there one among your associates who guides to the truth?" Say: "It is Allah who guides to the truth. Is he who guides to the truth more worthy of being followed, or is he who directs himself only in so far as he himself is directed? What is the matter with you? How do you judge that?"
And most of them follow only conjecture. But, conjecture is useless against the truth! Allah knows perfectly well what they are doing.
This Qur'an is in no way to be forged apart from Allah, but it is the confirmation of what already existed before it, and the detailed exposition of the Book in which there is no doubt, which came from the Lord of the Universe.
Or do they say, "He (Muhammad) invented it?" Say: "Compose a surah like this, and call for help from anyone you can, besides Allah, if you are truthful."
Quite the contrary: they have treated as a lie what they cannot embrace with their knowledge, and the interpretation of which has not yet reached them. Thus those who lived before them called their messengers impostors. Look at how the end of the unrighteous was!
Some of them believe in it, and others don't. And your Lord knows best the troublemakers.
And if they call you a liar, then say, "My work is mine, and yours is yours. You are irresponsible for what I do and I am irresponsible for what you do."
And there are some among them who lend an ear to you. Is it you who makes the deaf hear, even if they are unable to understand.
And there are some among them who look at you. Are you the one who can guide the blind, even if they do not see?
Verily, Allah is not unjust to people, but it is the people who do harm to themselves.
And the day He gathers them together, it will be as if they had stayed [in their tomb] only an hour of the day and they will recognize one another. The losers will then be those who have treated the encounter with Allah as a lie, and they will not have been properly guided.
Whether We show you a part of what We threaten them with, or whether We put you to death, (in any case), it is to Us that their return will be. Allah is also a witness of what they do.
To each community a Messenger. And when their messenger came, everything was decided in equity among them, and they were not wronged.
And they say, "When will this promise come, if you are truthful"?
Say: "I have nothing for myself that can harm or benefit me, except what Allah wills. Each community has a term. When their term comes, they can neither delay it by an hour nor bring it forward."
Say: "See! If His punishment came to you night or day, could the criminals hasten it?
"Will you believe when the punishment comes? [You will be told, "Useless."] Right now! In the past, you [ironically] demanded its speedy arrival!"
Then it will be said to the unjust: "Taste eternal punishment! Are you paid otherwise than in proportion to what you acquired?"
And they inquire of you, "Is it true?" – Say, "Yes! By my Lord! That's true. And you cannot escape the power of Allah.
If every unrighteous soul possessed all that is on earth, he would give it for his ransom. They will hide their regret when they see the punishment. And it shall be decided between them in all equity, and they shall not be wronged.
Verily, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. Verily, Allah's promise is truth. But most of them don't know (it).
It is He who gives life and gives death; and to Him you will be brought back.
O people! An exhortation has come to you from your Lord, a healing of what is in the breasts, a guide and a mercy for believers.
Say: "[This is] from the grace of Allah and His mercy; This is something they should be happy about. It's much better than anything they amass."
What do you say about what Allah has sent down for you as sustenance and which you have then made lawful and forbidden things about? Say: "Has Allah permitted you to do so? Or are you fabricating lies against Allah?"
And what will those who forge a lie against Allah think on the Day of Resurrection? - Verily, Allah is the Possessor of grace for people, but most of them are not grateful.
You shall not be in any situation, you shall not recite any passage of the Qur'an, you shall not perform any deed without Our witnessing at the time you undertake it. Neither the weight of an atom on earth or in heaven escapes your Lord, nor a smaller or greater weight that is not already written in an obvious book.
Verily, the beloved of Allah will be free from all fear, and they will not be afflicted,
those who believe and fear [Allah].
There is a good announcement for them in the life of this world as well as in the ultimate life. - There will be no change in the words of Allah -. This is a huge success!
Don't let what they say distress you. All power belongs to Allah. He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. What then do those who besides Allah follow [the gods] whom they associate with Him? They only follow conjecture and only lie.
It is He who has appointed you at night to rest, and during the day to allow you to see. These are indeed signs for the people who hear!
They say: "Allah has given Himself a child." He is The Rich One par excellence. To Him belongs all that is in heaven and on earth; - You have no proof for this. Are you going to say against Allah what you do not know?
Say: "Verily, those who forge lies against Allah will not succeed."
It is a (temporary) enjoyment in the life of this world; then they will return to Us and We will give them a taste of harsh punishment as a punishment for their disbelief.
Tell them the story of Noah, when he said to his people: "O my people, if my sojourn (among you) and my remembrance of the signs of Allah weigh too heavily on you, then I trust in Allah. Consult with your associates, and do not conceal your designs. Then decide on me and give me no respite.
If you turn away, then I didn't ask you for a salary... My salary belongs only to Allah. And I have been commanded to be among the submissive."
They called him a liar. We saved him and those who were with him in the ark, and made them successors (on earth). We drowned those who treated Our proofs as lies. Look at how the end of those who had been warned was!
Then We sent messengers after him to their peoples. They came to them with the proofs. But (the people) were such that they could not believe what they had previously called a lie. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors.
Then We sent Moses and Aaron after them with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his nobles. But (these people) were puffed up with pride and they were a criminal people.
And when the truth came to them from Us, they said, "Verily, this is manifest magic."
Moses said, "Say to the Truth when it came to you, 'Is this magic?' Whereas magicians do not succeed..."
They said, "Is it to depart from what we found our ancestors on that you have come to us, and that the greatness may belong to you both on earth? And we don't believe in you!"
And Pharaoh said, "Bring me every learned magician."
Then when the magicians came, Moses said to them, "Throw away what you have to throw."
When they threw away, Moses said, "What you have produced is magic! Allah will annul it. For Allah does not prosper what the troublemakers do.
And by His words, Allah will make the Truth triumph, however much the criminals may be repulsed by it."
No one believed (the message) of Moses, except a group of young men of his people, for fear of reprisals from Pharaoh and their notables. In truth, Pharaoh was certainly superb on earth and he was among the extravagant.
And Moses said, "O my people, if you believe in Allah, put your trust in Him if you are submissive."
They said, "In Allah we place our trust. O our Lord, do not make us a target for the persecution of the unjust.
And deliver us, by Your mercy, from disbelievers."
And We revealed to Moses and his brother: "Take houses for your people in Egypt, make your houses a place of prayer, and be diligent in prayer. And give good news to believers."
And Moses said, "O our Lord, Thou hast bestowed upon Pharaoh and his notables adornments and possessions in this present life, and behold, O our Lord, with this they are leading (the people far aside) from Thy path. O our Lord, destroy their possessions and harden their hearts, that they may not believe, until they have seen the painful punishment."
He said, "Your prayer is answered. Stay both on the straight path, and do not walk in the path of those who do not know."
And We took the Children of Israel across the sea. Pharaoh and his armies pursued them with fury and enmity. Then, when he had drowned, he said, "I believe that there is no god but Him in whom the children of Israel believed. And I am one of the submissives."
[Allah says]: Now? Whereas before you disobeyed and were among the corrupters!
Today we will spare your body, so that you may become a sign to your successors. However, many people pay no attention to Our (warning) signs.
Verily, We have established the Children of Israel in an honorable place, and have given them good food as food. Thereafter, they diverged only when science came to them. Your Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection what divided them.
And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to you, then ask those who read the Book revealed before you. The truth has come to you from your Lord: therefore do not be of those who doubt.
And do not be one of those who call the verses of Allah a lie. You would then be among the losers.
Those against whom the word (threat) of your Lord is fulfilled will not believe,
even if all the signs came to them, until they saw the painful punishment.
If only there was, apart from the people of Yunus (Jonah), a city that believed and whose belief had then profited! When they had believed, We took away from them the punishment of ignominy in this life and gave them enjoyment for a time.
If your Lord had willed, all who are on earth would have believed. Is it up to you to force people to become believers?
It is not proper for a soul to believe except with the permission of Allah. And He condemns to punishment those who do not reason.
Say: "Look at what is in the heavens and on the earth." But neither proofs nor warnings (prophets) are enough for people who do not believe.
Do they expect anything other than punishments similar to those of previous peoples? Say: "Wait! I, too, am waiting with you."
Then We will deliver Our Messengers and believers. Thus it is incumbent upon Us to deliver the believers.
Say: "O people! If you are in doubt about my religion, I do not worship those whom you worship except Allah; but I worship Allah who will put you to death. And I have been commanded to be of the believers."
And (I was told): "Orient yourself exclusively on religion as a pure monotheist! And do not be of the number of the Associates;
and do not invoke except Allah that which cannot benefit you or harm you. And if you do this, then you will be among the unjust."
And if Allah causes evil to befall you, no one can remove it except Him. And if He wishes you good, no one can reject His grace. He rewards whomever He wants among His servants. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
Say: "O people! Verily the truth has come to you from your Lord. Therefore, whoever is on the right path is only on the right path for himself; and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to his own detriment. I am in no way a protector for you.
And follow what is revealed to you, and be steadfast until Allah renders His judgment, for He is the best of judges.
Alif, Lâm, Râ. It is a Book whose verses are perfect in style and meaning, emanating from a Sage, a Perfect Knower.
Worship only Allah. I am a warner and a herald for you from Him.
Ask forgiveness from your Lord; then come back to Him. He will grant you a beautiful enjoyment until a fixed term, and He will grant to each deserving person the honor he deserves. But if you turn your back, then I fear for you the punishment of a great day.
To Allah will be your return; and He is Omnipotent.
What! They fold their breasts in order to hide themselves from Him. Even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they are hiding and what they are disclosing, for He certainly knows the contents of the breasts.
There is no beast on earth whose sustenance does not belong to Allah, who knows its dwelling place and its deposit; everything is in an explicit Book.
And He's the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days, while His Throne was on the water, to test which of you would do best. And if you say, "You will be resurrected after death," those who do not believe will say, "This is just obvious magic."
And if We delay the punishment for them until a fixed period, they will say, "What is holding him back?" - But on the day it comes to them, he will not be turned away; of them and what they mocked will envelop them.
And if We make man taste a grace from Us, and then wrest it from him, he is desperate and ungrateful.
And if We give him a taste of happiness, after a misfortune has befallen him, he will say, "The evils have departed from me," and there he rejoices, full of glory.
except those who are enduring and do good works. They will get forgiveness and a big reward.
You may neglect some of what is revealed to you, and your chest may feel compressed; because they say, "Why has not treasure been sent down upon him?" Or, "Why didn't an angel come with him?" – You're just a warner. And Allah is the protector of all things.
Or they say: "He has forged it [the Qur'an]" - Say: "Bring then ten Surahs like this, forged (by you). And call whomever you can, except Allah, if you are truthful."
If they do not answer you, then know that it is through the knowledge of Allah that He has descended, and that there is no god but Him. Are you subject (to Him)?
Those who want the present life with its adornment, We will reward them exactly according to their actions on earth, without any diminishment to them.
Those who have nothing in the afterlife but Fire. What they have done here below will be a failure, and what they have worked will be in vain.
Is he who bases himself on a clear proof (the Qur'an) from his Lord and recited by a witness [the archangel Gabriel] on His behalf, while before him [Muhammad] there is the book of Moses as a guide and mercy... [is better or is it that is not based on any valid evidence?]. They believe in it; but whoever of the factions does not believe in it, will have Fire as his rendezvous. So do not be in doubt about this. Yes, it is the truth from your Lord; But most people don't believe it.
And what worse unrighteous person than the one who forges a lie against Allah? These will be presented to their Lord, and the witnesses (the angels) will say, "These are the ones who have lied against their Lord." May the curse of Allah befall the unjust,
who obstruct the path of Allah (to the people), seek to make it crooked, and do not believe in the Hereafter.
They cannot reduce (Allah) to impotence on earth! There are no allies for them but Allah and their punishment will be doubled. They were unable to hear; nor could they see.
These are the ones who have caused the loss of their own souls. And their inventions (idols) have moved away from them.
It is they, infallibly, who will be the biggest losers in the afterlife.
Verily, those who believe, do good works, and humble themselves before their Lord, these are the people of Paradise, where they will dwell forever.
The two groups resemble, one the blind and the deaf, the other the one who sees and hears. Are the two comparatively equal? Don't you remember?
We have already sent Noah to his people: "I am a clear warner to you
so that you may worship only Allah. I fear for you the punishment of a painful day."
Then the leaders of his people who had disbelieved said there, "We see in you only a man like us; and we see that it is only the vile among us who follow you without thinking; and we see in you no superiority over us. Rather, we think you are liars."
He said, "O my people! What do you think of it? If I conform to a proof of my Lord, if a mercy (prophecy) that escapes your eyes has come to me from Him, shall we impose it on you when you repugnant it?
O my people, I do not ask you for riches in return. My salary belongs only to Allah. I will not reject those who have believed, they will have to meet their Lord. But I find you ignorant people.
O my people, who will help me against Allah if I reject them? Don't you remember?
And I do not tell you that I hold the treasures of Allah, I do not know the Unknowable, and I do not say that I am an angel; nor do I say to the people, whom your eyes despise, that Allah will not grant them any favor; Allah knows best what is in their souls. [If I told them], I would be among the unjust.
They said, "O Noah, you have argued with us and multiplied the arguments. Bring us, then, what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful."
He said: "Allah alone will bring it to you, if He wills, and you will not be able to escape it.
And my advice would not benefit you, in case I wanted to advise you, and Allah would lead you astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be brought back."
Or do they say: he invented it? Say: "If I invented it, let my crime fall upon me! And I am innocent of your criminal accusations."
And it was revealed to Noah, "Of your people there will be no believers but those who have already believed. Do not grieve over what they did.
And build the ark before Our eyes and according to Our revelation. And do not call Me out any more about the unrighteous, for they will be drowned."
And he was building the ark. And whenever the notables of his people passed by him, they laughed at him. He said, "If you mock us, well, we will mock you, as you mock [us].
And you will soon know to whom a punishment will come that will humiliate him, and on whom a lasting punishment will fall!"
Then when Our command came and the oven began to bubble [with water], We said: "Load [into the ark] a couple of every kind as well as your family - except those against whom the decree has already been pronounced - and those who believe." But those who had believed with him were few.
And he said, "Get in. May his course and anchorage be in the name of Allah. Verily my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."
And she sailed, carrying them among the waves like mountains. And Noah called to his son, who was staying in a secluded place (not far from the ark), "O my son, go up with us and do not stay with the disbelievers."
He replied, "I will take refuge in a mountain that will protect me from the water." And Noah said to him, "Today there is no protector against the command of Allah. (All will perish) except the one to whom He has mercy." And the waves came between the two, and the son was then among the drowned.
And it was said, "O earth, absorb your water! And you, heaven, stop [raining]!" The water went down, the order was carried out and the ark was set up on the Judi, and it was said: "Let the wicked disappear"!
And Noah called upon his Lord and said, "O my Lord, certainly my son is of my family, and Your promise is truth. You are the most just of judges."
He said, "O Noah, he is not of your family because he has committed a disgraceful deed. Don't ask me what you don't know about. I exhort you not to be among the ignorant."
Then Noah said, "Lord, I seek Your protection from every demand of that of which I have no knowledge. And if You do not forgive me and show me mercy, I will be among the losers."
It was said, "O Noah, come with Our safety and blessings upon you and upon the communities of those who are with you. And there will be communities to which We will grant temporary enjoyment; then a painful punishment from Us will come upon them."
Here is some news of the Unknowable that We reveal to you. You didn't know them, neither you nor your people, before that. Be patient. The happy ending will be to the pious.
And (We sent) to the 'Aad, their brother Hud, who said to them: "O my people, worship Allah. You have no god but Him. You are only forgers (of lies).
O my people, I do not ask you for a reward for this. My salary belongs only to the One who created me. Are you not reasoning?
O my people, beg your Lord's forgiveness and repent to Him that He may send abundant rains upon you from heaven and add strength to your strength. And do not turn away [from Him] by becoming guilty."
They said, "O Hud, you have not come to us with a proof, and we are not willing to surrender our gods at your word, and we have no faith in you.
We will rather say that one of our gods has afflicted you with an evil." He said: "I call Allah to witness - and you also be witnesses - that verily I disavow what you associate,
outside of Him. Cunning, therefore, all against me, and give me no respite.
I place my trust in Allah, my Lord and yours. There is no living being that He does not hold by His toupee. My Lord, indeed, is on the right path.
If you turn away... now I have conveyed to you [the message] which I was instructed to convey to you. And my Lord will replace you with another people, without your harming Him in any way, for my Lord is the guardian par excellence over all things."
And when Our Order came, We saved by a mercy on Our part, Hud and those who had believed with him. And We saved them from a terrible punishment.
These are the 'Aad. They had denied the signs (teachings) of their Lord, disobeyed His messengers, and followed the command of every stubborn tyrant.
And they were chased here on earth with a curse, as well as on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, the 'Aad did not believe in their Lord. Let the 'Aad, the people of Hud, depart (perish)!
And (We sent) to the Thamud, their brother Salih who said: "O my people, worship Allah. You have no divinity besides Him. From the earth He created you, and He made you populate (and exploit) it. So beg His forgiveness, and then repent to Him. My Lord is very close and He always responds (to calls)."
They said, "O Salih, you were once a hope for us. Would you forbid us to worship what our ancestors worshipped? However, here we are in a troubling doubt about what you are inviting us towards."
He said, "O my people! What do you think, if I rely on a clear proof from my Lord and He has shown me mercy from Him, who will protect me from Allah if I disobey Him? You will only increase my loss.
O my people, this is the she-camel of Allah that He has sent you as a sign. Let her tread in the land of Allah, and do not harm her, otherwise you will be punished at hand."
They killed her. Then he said to them, "Enjoy (your goods) in your dwellings for three days (more)! This is a promise that will not be denied."
Then, when Our command came, We saved Salih and those who had believed with him, by a mercy from Us, from the ignominy of that day. Verily, it is your Lord who is the Strong, the Mighty.
And the Cry seizes the unrighteous. And here they are thunderstruck by lightning in their homes,
as if they had never prospered there. In truth, the Thamûd did not believe in their Lord. May the Thamud perish!
And Our emissaries came to Abraham with the good news, saying, "Salam." He said, "Salam," and he soon brought a roast calf.
Then, when he saw that their hands did not approach him, he was seized with suspicion of them and felt fear of them. They said, "Do not be afraid, we are sent to the people of Lot."
His wife was standing, and she laughed then; So we told him (the birth of) Isaac, and after Isaac, Jacob.
She said, "Woe to me! Am I going to give birth when I am old and my husband, who is here, an old man? This is really a strange thing!"
They said, "Are you surprised at the command of Allah? May Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you, the people of this house! He is truly worthy of praise and glorification!"
When the fear had left Abraham and the good news had reached him, behold, he argued with Us (on behalf of) the people of Lot.
Abraham was, indeed, long-suffering, very imploring and repentant.
O Abraham, renounce this; for the command of your Lord has already come, and an irrevocable punishment will come upon them."
And when Our emissaries (angels) came to Lot, he was grieved for them, and was greatly troubled by it. And he said, "This is a terrible day."
As for his people, they came to him, running. Before, they committed evil deeds. He said, "O my people, these are my daughters: they are purer to you. Fear Allah, therefore, and do not dishonor me in my hosts. Is there not a reasonable man among you?"
They said, "You know very well that we have no right to your daughters." And in truth, you know well what we want."
He said, "[Ah!] if I had strength to resist you! or if I found a solid support!"
Then [the hosts] said, "O Lot, we are truly the emissaries of your Lord. They will never be able to reach you. Go with your family at some point during the night. And let none of you look back. Except for your wife who will be affected by what will strike others. What threatens them will be fulfilled at dawn. Isn't dawn near?"
And when Our command came, We overthrew [the city] from top to bottom, and rained down on it in masses, stones of clay one after another,
bearing a mark known to your Lord. And they (these stones) are not far from the unjust.
And (We sent) to the Madyan, their brother Chuayb who said to them: "O my people, worship Allah; you have no divinity but Him. And don't decrease measurements and weight. I see you in ease, and I fear for you [if you do not believe] the punishment of a day that will envelop everything.
O my people, do not fairly make full measure and full weight, do not belittle people their values and do not sow corruption on earth.
What remains with Allah is better for you if you are believers. And I'm not a guardian for you."
They said, "O Chuayb! Does your prayer ask you to make us abandon what our ancestors worshipped, or to no longer do with our goods what we want? Are you the indulgent, the right?"
He said, "O my people, do you see if I am basing myself on a clear proof from my Lord, and if He gives me an excellent gift from Him?... I do not want to do what I forbid you to do. I want only reform, as far as I can. And my success depends only on Allah. In Him I place my trust, and it is to Him that I return in repentance.
O my people, let not your repugnance and hostility towards me lead you to incur the same punishments that befell the people of Noah, the people of Hud, or the people of Salih, and (the example of) the people of Lot is not far from you.
And beg your Lord's forgiveness and repent to Him. My Lord is truly Merciful and full of love."
They said, "O Chuayb, we do not understand much of what you are saying; and truly we consider you a weak among us. If it weren't for your clan, we would certainly have stoned you. And nothing prevents us from reaching you."
He said: "O my people, is my clan in your eyes more powerful than Allah, to whom you openly turn your back? My Lord embraces (in His knowledge) all that you do.
O my people, act as much as you will. I too act. Soon you will know on whom a punishment will fall that will dishonor him, and who of us is the impostor. And wait (for the consequence of your actions)! I too am waiting with you."
When Our command came, We saved, by mercy on Our part, Chuayb and those who had believed with him. And the terrible cry seized the unjust, and they lay in their dwellings,
as if they had never prospered there. Let the Madyan depart as the Thamûd have departed.
And We sent Moses, with Our miracles and unquestionable authority,
to Pharaoh and his notables. But they followed Pharaoh's command, although Pharaoh's command made no sense.
He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection. He will lead them to the Aiguade du Feu. And what a detestable aiguade!
And they are pursued by a curse here on earth and on the Day of Resurrection. What a detestable gift will be given to them!
This is one of the narrations that We [Muhammad] tell you about cities: some are still standing, while others are completely razed to the ground.
We have done them no harm. But they have wronged themselves. Their gods, whom they invoked besides Allah, availed them no good, when the order (punishment) of your Lord came; they have only increased their loss.
Such is the severity of your Lord's capture when He strikes cities when they are unjust. His punishment is very painful and very harsh.
This is a sign for one who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. It is a day when people will be brought together; and it is a solemn day (attested by all).
And We delay it only for a very specific period.
On the day this happens, no soul will speak except with His (Allah's) permission. There will be the damned and the happy.
Those who are damned will be in the Fire where they have sighs and sobs.
To remain there forever as long as the heavens and the earth endure - unless your Lord decides otherwise - for your Lord does absolutely everything He wills.
And as for the blessed, they will be in Paradise, to dwell there forever as long as the heavens and the earth endure - unless your Lord decides otherwise - this is a gift that is never interrupted.
So don't be in doubt about what these worship. They worship only as their ancestors worshipped before. And We will give them all of their share, without taking anything away from it.
And We have already given Moses the Book. There were differences about him. If there had not been a prior decree from your Lord, everything would have been decided between them. And they are full of troubling doubt about him.
Most certainly, your Lord will make their full retribution to all for their works... He is a Perfectly Knowledgeable of what they do.
Abide on the right path as you are commanded, as well as those who have returned with you. And don't go overboard. For truly He is watching what you do.
And do not bend to the unjust, or the Fire will come upon you. You have no allies besides Allah. And you will not be rescued.
And perform Salat at both ends of the day and at certain hours of the night. Good works dispel bad ones. This is an exhortation for those who reflect.
And be patient. For Allah does not let the reward of good people be lost.
If only there were righteous people in the generations before you who forbid corruption on earth! (Alas) There were only a few whom We saved, while the unrighteous persisted in the (exaggerated) luxury in which they lived, and they were criminals.
And your Lord is not such as to unjustly destroy cities whose inhabitants are reformers.
And if your Lord had willed, He would have made the people one community. However, they are constantly at odds (among themselves,)
except those to whom your Lord has granted mercy. That's why He created them. And the word of your Lord is fulfilled: "Most certainly, I will fill Hell with jinn and men, all together."
And all that We tell you of the narrations of the messengers is to strengthen your heart. And from these came the truth and an exhortation and a reminder to the believers.
And say to those who do not believe, "Work as much as you can. We are also working.
And wait. We are waiting too!"
To Allah belongs the Unknowable of the heavens and the earth, and to Him belongs the whole order. Worship Him, therefore, and place your trust in Him. Your Lord is not inattentive to what you do.
Alif, Lâm, Râ. These are the verses of the Explicit Book.
We sent it down, a Qur'an in Arabic, so that you might reason.
We tell you the best narration because We reveal to you in this Qur'an, even though you were previously one of the inattentive (to these narrations).
When Joseph said to his father, "O my father, I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars, and also the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrate before me."
"O my son," he said, "do not tell your brothers your vision, for they would plot against you; the Devil is certainly an open enemy to man.
So your Lord will choose you and teach you the interpretation of dreams, and He will perfect His blessing on you and on Jacob's family, just as He perfected it before on your two ancestors, Abraham and Isaac, for your Lord is All-Knowing and Wise.
There were certainly exhortations in Joseph and his brethren to those who question,
when they said, "Joseph and his brother are more beloved by our father than we are, even though we are a very strong group. Our father is really in the wrong.
Kill Joseph or remove him to any country, so that your father's face may be turned exclusively to you, and that after that you may be good people."
One of them said, "Do not kill Joseph, but throw him if you are willing to do so, to the bottom of the well so that some caravan can pick him up."
They said, "O our father, why do you not trust us about Joseph? However, we have good intentions towards it.
Send him with us to-morrow for a walk and play. And we will watch over him."
He said, "Surely I will be sad if you take him away; and I fear that the wolf will devour him at a time when you will not pay attention to him."
They said, "If the wolf devours him when there are many of us, we will really be the losers."
And when they had taken him away, and had agreed to throw him into the invisible depths of the well, We revealed to him: "You will surely inform them of this matter without their realizing it."
And they came to their father in the evening, weeping.
They said, "O our father, we have gone on an errand and left Joseph with our belongings; and the wolf devoured him. You will not believe us, even if we tell the truth."
They brought his tunic, which was stained with fake blood. He said, "Your souls, rather, suggested something to you... [So all I have left] is a nice patience! It is Allah who must be called for help against what you say."
Now came a caravan. They sent their water seeker, who lowered his bucket. He said, "Good news! That's a boy!" And they hid it [to sell] like a commodity. Allah, however, knew very well what they were doing.
And they sold it at a low price: for a few dirhams counted. They considered him undesirable.
And the one who bought it was from Egypt. He said to his wife, "Give him generous hospitality. It may be useful to us or we may adopt it as our child." Thus we strengthened Joseph in the land and taught him the interpretation of dreams. And Allah is sovereign in His Commandment: but most people do not know.
And when he had reached maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how we reward the beneficent.
Now she [Zulikha] who had received him into her house tried to seduce him. And she closed the doors tightly and said, "Come, (I am ready for you!)" - He said, "May Allah protect me! It was my master who granted me a good asylum. Truly the unrighteous do not succeed."
And she desired it. And he would have desired it had it not been for what he saw as a clear proof of his Lord. Thus [We acted] to remove evil and turpitude. He was certainly one of Our chosen servants.
And they both ran to the door, and she tore his tunic from behind. They found [the woman's] husband at the door. She said, "What would be the punishment for anyone who wanted to harm your family, if not prison, or a painful punishment?"
[Joseph] said, "It was she who wanted to seduce me." And a witness from her family testified: "If his tunic is torn from the front, then it is she who speaks the truth, while he is among the liars.
But if his tunic is torn from behind, then it is she who lies, while he is of the truthful."
Then, when he (the husband) saw the tunic torn from behind, he said: "It is indeed your cunning of women! Your tricks are really huge!
Joseph, don't think about that any more! And you, (woman), beg forgiveness for your sin because you are guilty."
And in the city, some women said, "The wife of Al-'Azize is trying to seduce her valet! He really made her mad with love. We certainly find it in an obvious way.
When she heard their deceit, she sent them [invitations,] and prepared a collation for them; and she gave each of them a knife. Then she said, "Come out before them, (Joseph!)" - When they saw him, they admired him, cut off their hands and said, "Allah forbid! He is not a human being, he is only a noble angel!"
She said, "So that's the one you blamed me for. I tried to seduce him but he firmly defended himself. But if he does not do what I command him, he will most certainly be imprisoned and will certainly be among the humiliated."
He said, "O my Lord, prison is preferable to me than what they invite me to do. And if You do not remove their cunning from me, I will lean towards them and be among the ignorant" [sinners].
So his Lord heard him, and removed their cunning from him. It is He, truly, who is the Hearer and the All-Knowing.
Then, after they had seen the proofs (of his innocence), it seemed to them that they should imprison him for a time.
Two servants entered the prison with him. One of them said, "I saw myself [in a dream] pressing grapes..." And the other said, "And I saw myself carrying bread on my head that the birds were eating of. Teach us the interpretation (of our dreams), we see you among the beneficents."
"The food allotted to you shall not come to you," he said, "until I have informed you of his interpretation [of your food] before it comes to you. This is part of what my Lord has taught me. Certainly, I have abandoned the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah and who deny the future life."
And I followed the religion of my ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not proper for us to associate anything with Allah. This is a grace from Allah upon us and upon everyone; But most people are not grateful.
O my two companions in prison! Who is better: scattered Lords or Allah, the One, the Supreme Ruler?
Apart from Him, you worship only names that you and your ancestors have invented, and for which Allah has sent down no proof. Power belongs only to Allah. He has commanded you to worship Him alone. Such is the right religion; But most people don't know.
O my two companions in prison! One of you will give his master some wine to drink; and the other will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter on which you are consulting me has already been decided."
And he said to the one of the two from whom he thought he would be delivered, "Speak of me to your master." But the Devil caused him to forget to remind (Joseph's case) of his master. Joseph therefore remained in prison for a few years.
And the king said, "Verily, I saw (in a dream) seven fat cows eaten by seven skinny ones; and seven green ears, and as many others, dry. O council of notables, give me an explanation of my vision, if you know how to interpret the dream."
They said, "It's a heap of dreams! And we don't know how to interpret dreams!"
Now the one of the two who had been delivered, and after some time remembered, said, "I will give you the interpretation of it. Send me, then."
"O you, Joseph, the truthful one! Enlighten us about seven fat cows eaten by seven very thin ones, and seven green ears and as many others, dry, so that I may return to the people and they may know [the exact interpretation of the dream]."
Then [Joseph said], "You shall sow for seven consecutive years. Whatever you have harvested, leave it on the cob, except the little you consume.
Then will come seven years of scarcity, which will consume all that you have gathered for them, except the little that you have set aside.
Then there will come a year after that when people will be rescued [by the rain] and go to the winepress."
And the king said, "Bring him to me." Then, when the emissary came to him, [Joseph] said, "Go back to your master and ask him, 'What was the reason that caused the women to cut off their hands? My Lord knows their cunning well."
Then [the king said to them], "What made you try to seduce Joseph?" They said, "Allah forbid! We know nothing bad against him." And the wife of Al-'Azize said: "Now the truth has come out. It was I who wanted to seduce him. And it is he, truly, who is among the truthful!"
"This is so that he may know that I have not betrayed him in his absence, and that in truth Allah does not guide the cunning of traitors.
I do not exonerate myself, however, for the soul is very inclined to evil, unless my Lord, out of mercy, [preserves it from sin]. My Lord is indeed Forgiving and Most Merciful."
And the king said, "Bring it to me, and I will keep it for myself." And when he had spoken to him, he said, "You are with us this day, in a position of authority and trust."
And [Joseph] said, "Assign me the deposits of the land: I am a good guardian and a connoisseur."
Thus we established (the authority of) Joseph in this territory and he settled there where he wanted. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and do not cause good men to lose the merit [of their works].
And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who have believed and practiced godliness.
And Joseph's brothers came and came to him. He recognized them, but they did not.
And when he had given them their provisions, he said, "Bring me a brother whom you have by your father. Don't you see that I give my full measure and that I am the best of hosts?
And if you do not bring it to me, then there will be no provision for you in my house; and you shall not approach me again."
They said, "We will try to persuade his father. Certainly, we will."
And he said to his servants, "Put their goods back in their sacks: perhaps they will recognize them when they return to their families and perhaps they will return."
And when they returned to their father, they said, "O our father, we will be denied [in the future] food [in grain]. Send our brother with us, so that we may obtain provisions. We will keep a close eye on him."
He said, "Shall I entrust him to you as I entrusted his brother to you before? But Allah is the best guardian, and He is the Most Merciful of the Merciful."
And when they opened their luggage, they found that their goods had been returned to them. They said, "O our father. What do we want? Now our goods have been returned to us. And in this way we will provide for our family, we will ensure the safety of our brother and we will add to ourselves the load of a camel and it is an easy burden."
He said: "I will never send him with you, until you bring me a formal commitment in the name of Allah that you will bring it back to me unless you are surrounded." When they had given him the commitment, he said: "Allah is the guarantor of what we say."
And he said, "O my sons, do not enter by one door, but enter by separate doors. However, I cannot be of any use to you against Allah's designs. The decision belongs only to Allah, and in Him I place my trust. And let those who place their trust in Him place it."
Having entered as their father had commanded them, [this] availed them nothing against (the decrees of) Allah. It was only a precaution that Jacob had judged [to recommend to them]. He had full knowledge of what We had taught him. But most people don't know.
And when they had come to Joseph, [he] held his brother to him, saying, "I am your brother. So don't be upset about what they did."
Then, when he had provided them with their provisions, he put the cup in his brother's sack. Then a crier announced: "Caravanners! you are thieves."
They turned around and said, "What have you lost?"
They answered, "We are looking for the great cup of the king. The load of a camel to whoever brings it and I am the guarantor of it."
"By Allah," they said, "you know that we have not come to sow corruption in the land and that we are not thieves."
- So what will be the punishment if you are liars? (they said).
They said: "The punishment for the one whose baggage is found is: [let him] be delivered himself [as a slave to the victim of the robbery]. This is how we punish the wrongdoers."
[Joseph] began with the sacks of others before his brother's; then he took her out of his brother's bag. Thus We suggested this artifice to Joseph. For he could not seize his brother, according to the king's justice, unless Allah had willed it. We raise in rank whomever We will. And above every man who possesses knowledge there is a scholar [more learned than he].
They said, "If he has committed theft, a brother of his before has stolen also." But Joseph kept his thought secret, and did not reveal it to them. He says [to himself]: "Your position is much worse! And Allah knows best what you describe."
- They said. "O Al-'Azize, he has a very old father; take hold of one of us, then, in his place." We see that you are truly among the beneficent people."
He said: "May Allah forbid that we should take anyone other than the one with whom we have found our property. We would then be really unfair."
Then, when they had lost all hope [of bringing back Benyamin], they consulted in secret. Their eldest son said, "Do you not know that your father made a formal commitment from you in the name of Allah, and that you have already broken it in the past about Joseph? I will not leave the land until my father permits me to do so, or until Allah judges in my favor, and He is the best of judges.
Go back to your father and say, "O our father, your son has stolen. And we only attest to what we know. And we were in no way aware of the unknown.
And questions the city where we were, as well as the caravan in which we arrived. We are really telling the truth."
Then [Jacob] said, "Your souls rather have inspired you to do something... Oh! nice patience. It may be that Allah will bring them both back to me. For He is the All-Knowing, the Wise."
And he turned away from them and said, "How great is my sorrow for Joseph!" And his eyes turned white with sorrow. And he was overwhelmed.
They said: "By Allah! You shall not cease to evoke Joseph until you are exhausted or are among the dead."
He said: "I complain only to Allah about my heartbreak and sorrow. And I know from Allah what you do not know.
O my sons! Go and inquire about Joseph and his brother. And do not despair of Allah's mercy. It is only the disbelievers who despair of Allah's mercy."
And when they came to [Joseph,] they said, "O al-'Azize, famine has come upon us and our family; and we come with a commodity of little value. Give us a full measure, and give us charity. Verily, Allah rewards the charitable."
- He said, "Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant? [unfair]".
- They said, "Are you... Verily, you are Joseph!" - He said, "I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Verily, Allah favored us. Whoever fears and waits... And most certainly, Allah does not cause the reward of the doers to be lost."
They said: "By Allah! Truly Allah preferred you to us and we were at fault."
- He says, "No recrimination against you today! May Allah forgive you. He is the most merciful of the merciful.
Take away this this tunic of my tunic and put it on my father's face, and he will immediately receive his sight. And bring me your whole family."
- And as soon as the caravan crosses the border [of Canaan], their father says: "I can see the smell of Joseph, even if you say that I ramble."
They said to him, "By Allah, you are in your old error."
Then when the bearer of good news arrived, he put it [the tunic] on Jacob's face. He immediately received his sight and said, "Have I not told you that I know by Allah what you do not know?"
- They said, "O our father, implore for us the forgiveness of our sins. We were really at fault."
- He said, "I will implore my Lord's forgiveness for you. For He is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful."
When they came to Joseph, he welcomed his father and mother and said to them, "Enter Egypt in safety, Allah willing."
And he raised his parents to the throne, and they all fell down before him, prostrate. And he said, "O my father, this is the interpretation of my dream of old. Allah has indeed achieved this... And He certainly did me good when He brought me out of prison and brought you out of the country, [out of the desert], after the Devil stirred up discord between my brothers and me. My Lord is full of meekness for what He wills. And He is the All-Knowing, the Wise.
O my Lord, You have given me power and taught me the interpretation of dreams. [It's you the] Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my patron, here below and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die in perfect submission and make me join the virtuous.
These are unknown stories that We reveal to you. And you were not with them when they agreed to plot.
And most people are not believers despite your ardent desire.
And you don't ask them for any salary for it. This is only a reminder to the universe.
And in heaven and on earth, how many signs people pass by, turning away from them!
And most of them believe in Allah only by giving Him partners.
Are they sure that Allah's punishment will not come to cover them or that the Hour will not come to them suddenly, without them realizing it?
Say: "This is my way, I call the people to the [religion] of Allah, me and those who follow me, based on clear evidence. Glory be to Allah! And I am not one of the associates.
We have sent before you only men from the cities, to whom We have made revelations. Didn't [these people] walk the earth and consider what was the end of those who lived before them? The abode of the Hereafter is certainly better for those who fear [Allah]. Will you not then reason?
When the messengers almost lost hope (and their followers) thought they were being duped, behold, Our help came to them. And those whom We willed were saved. But Our rigour cannot be turned away from criminals.
In their stories there is certainly a lesson for people endowed with intelligence. This is not a fabricated story. Rather, it is the confirmation of what already existed before him, a detailed exposition of all things, a guide and a mercy for people who believe.
Alif, Lâm, Mîm, Râ. These are the verses of the Book; and that which has been revealed to you by your Lord is the truth; But most people don't believe.
Allah is the One who has exalted the heavens without visible pillars. He established Himself [istawâ] on the Throne and subdued the sun and the moon, each pursuing its course towards a fixed term. He regulates the Order [of everything] and sets forth in detail the signs so that you may have the certainty of the encounter with your Lord.
And it is He who has spread out the earth and placed mountains and rivers in it. And of each species of fruit He establishes two elements of couple. He makes the night cover the day. These are proofs for people who think.
And on the earth there are plots of land next to each other, gardens [planted] with vines, and cereals and palms, in tufts or spaced out, watered with the same water, yet We make one superior to the other in taste. These are proofs for people who reason.
And if you are to be surprised, nothing is more astonishing than their words: "When we are dust, will we really return to a new creation?" These are those who do not believe in their Lord. And they are the ones who will have yokes around their necks. And they are the people of the Fire, where they will dwell forever.
And they ask you to hasten [the coming] of misfortune rather than that of happiness. Certainly, exemplary punishments have occurred before them. Your Lord is the Holder of forgiveness for people, despite their misdeeds. And your Lord is certainly harsh in punishment.
And those who disbelieve say: "Why was not a miracle sent down upon this (Muhammad) from his Lord?" You are only a warner, and to each people a guide.
Allah knows what each female wears, and how much the gestation period in the womb is shortened or prolonged. And all things have their measure with Him.
The Knower of what is hidden and what is apparent, the Great, the Sublime.
Equal to him are he who keeps his word secret, and he who divulges it, he who hides himself at night as well as he who shows himself in broad daylight.
He has angels in front of him and behind him who take turns and watch over him by the command of Allah. Verily, Allah does not change the state of a people, as long as the people do not change what is in themselves. And when Allah wants to do harm to a people, no one can reject him, for they have no protector besides Him.
It is he who makes you see the lightning [that inspires you] fear and hope; and He creates the heavy clouds.
The thunder glorifies Him by His praise, and also the Angels, under the effect of His fear. And He hurls the thunderbolts with which He strikes whomever He wills. Now they argue about Allah when He is formidable in His might.
To Him is the call of Truth! Those whom they invoke apart from Him do not answer them in any way; like the one who stretches out both hands towards the water to bring it to his mouth, but never succeeds in reaching it. The supplication of the disbelievers is vanity.
And to Allah all those who are in the heavens and on the earth, and their shadows, prostrate themselves, willy-nilly, at the beginning and at the end of the day.
Say: "Who is the Lord of heaven and earth?" Say: "Allah." Say: "And will you take from Him masters who have neither good nor evil for themselves?" Say: "Are they equal, the blind and the seeing? Or are they equal, darkness and light? Or do they give to Allah partners who create as His creation to the point that the two creations are merged with them? Say: "Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme Ruler."
He sent down water from heaven, to which valleys serve as beds, according to their size. The overflowing flood has carried a floating foam; and similar to this is [the] foam from that which is brought to fusion, in the fire to [make] jewels and utensils. Thus Allah represents in a parable the Truth and the Falsehood: the foam [of the torrent and molten metal] goes away to the discard, while [the water and objects] useful to men remain on the earth. Thus Allah offers parables.
The best [end] is for those who respond to their Lord's [call]. And as for those who do not answer Him, if they had all that is on the earth, and as much as that, they would offer it as a ransom. These will have the detestable return on account and Hell will be their refuge. What a detestable daybed!
Is he who knows that what is revealed to you from your Lord the truth, like a blind man? Only people with intelligence think well,
those who fulfill their commitment to Allah and do not violate the covenant,
who unite what Allah has commanded to unite, fear their Lord and fear an unfortunate reckoning,
and who endure in seeking the pleasure of Allah, perform Salah and spend (in good), in secret and in public, what We have allotted to them, and repel evil with good. To these, the final good abode,
the gardens of Eden, which they will enter, as well as all those of their ascendants, spouses and descendants, who have been good believers. From each door, the Angels will enter to them:
- "Peace be upon you, for what you have endured!" - How good is your final home!"
[But] those who violate their covenant with Allah after committing Him, and break what Allah has commanded to unite and commit disorder on earth, will have a curse and an evil abode.
Allah greatly extends His gifts or restricts [them] to whomever He wills. They rejoice in life on earth, but life here below will appear only as an ephemeral enjoyment in comparison with the hereafter.
Those who have disbelieved say: "Why was not a miracle sent down on him (Muhammad) from his Lord?" Say: "Verily, Allah leads astray whomever He wills; and He guides to Himself the one who repents,
those who believed, and whose hearts are tranquilized at the remembrance of Allah." Certainly, it is by the evocation of Allah that hearts are at ease.
Those who believe and do good deeds, will have the greatest good and also the best return.
Thus We send you to a community - which other communities have preceded - so that you may recite to them what We reveal to you, even though they do not believe in the Most Merciful. Say: "He is my Lord. No other god but Him. In Him I place my trust. And to Him I repent."
If there were a Qur'an to set the mountains in motion, to split the earth or to make the dead speak (it would be this one). Rather, it is to Allah the entire commandment. Do not the believers know that, if Allah willed, He would have led all men to the right path? However, those who do not believe will not fail to be struck by a cataclysm as a reward for what they do, or that a cataclysm will befall their homes until the promise of Allah comes. For Allah does not break His promise.
Of course, the messengers were laughed at before you. So, I gave a respite to the disbelievers. Then I grabbed them. And what was My chastisement!
Is He who observes what each soul acquires [like the associates?...] And yet they give partners to Allah. Say [to them:] "Name them. Or are you trying to teach Him what He doesn't know on earth? Or were you simply seduced by fake names?" In fact, the disbelievers have been embellished with their stratagem and prevented from taking the right path. And whoever Allah allows to go astray, has no one left to guide him.
A chastisement will come upon them in this life. The punishment of the Hereafter, however, will be more crushing and they will have no protector against Allah.
This is the paradise that has been promised to the righteous: under which the streams flow; its fruits are perpetual, as is its shade. This is the end of those who practice godliness, while the end of the disbelievers will be the Fire.
And those to whom We have already given the Book rejoice that they have sent down to you. While some factions reject some of them. Say: "I have only been commanded to worship Allah and not to associate anything with Him. It is to Him that I call [the people], and it is to Him that my return will be."
Thus We have sent it down as a law in Arabic. And if you follow their passions after what you have received as knowledge, there will be no ally or protector for you against Allah.
And We have sent messengers before you, and have given them wives and descendants. And it is not for a Messenger to bring a miracle, except with Allah's permission. Each maturity has its prescribed term.
Allah erases or confirms what He wills and the primordial Scripture is with Him.
Whether We make you see any part of what We threaten them with, or whether We put you to death (before that), your duty is only the communication of the message, and the settling of accounts will be Ours.
Do they not see that We are striking the earth and reducing it on all sides? It is Allah who judges and no one can oppose His judgment, and He is quick to settle accounts.
Verily, those before them plotted (against their Messenger); the whole scheme belongs to Allah. He knows what each soul acquires. And the disbelievers will soon know to whom the final abode belongs.
And those who do not believe say, "You are not a Messenger." Say: "Allah is sufficient as a witness between you and me, and those who have knowledge of the Book (are also witnesses)."
Alif, Lâm, Râ. (Behold) a book which We have sent down upon you, so that - by the permission of their Lord - you may bring people out of darkness into the light, in the way of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy.
Allah, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. And woe to the disbelievers, for a severe punishment [which they will suffer].
Those who prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter, obstruct the path of Allah and seek to make it crooked, are far from being led astray.
And We have not sent a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order to enlighten them. Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Almighty, the Wise.
We sent Moses with Our miracles, saying, "Bring your people out of darkness into the light, and remind them of the days of Allah." [Its benefits]. In all this there are signs for every man full of endurance and gratitude.
(Remember) when Moses said to his people: "Remember the blessing of Allah upon you when He saved you from Pharaoh's people who inflicted the worst punishment on you. They slaughtered your sons and left your daughters alive. This was a severe trial on the part of your Lord,"
And when your Lord proclaimed, "If you are grateful, I will certainly increase [My blessings] for you. But if you are ungrateful, My punishment will be terrible."
And Moses said, "If you and all those on earth are ungrateful, [know] that Allah is sufficient in Himself and that He is worthy of praise.
Has not the narration come down to you of those before you, of the people of Noah, of the 'Aad, of the Thamud and of those who lived after them, and whom only Allah knows? Their messengers came to them with proofs, but they said, bringing their hands to their mouths, "We do not believe [the message] with which you were sent, and we are in a really troubling doubt about what you are calling us to."
Their messengers said: "Is there any doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who calls you to forgive you some of your sins and to give you a delay until a fixed time?" [The disbelievers] replied, "You are only men like us. You want to prevent us from what our ancestors worshipped. So bring us clear proof."
Their messengers said to them, "Surely we are only humans like you. But Allah favors whomever He wills among His servants. It is for us to give you any proof only by the permission of Allah. And it is in Allah that the believers must place their trust.
And what would we have if we did not put our trust in Allah, when He has guided us in the paths [that we should follow]? We will surely endure the persecution you inflict on us. And those who trust in Allah entrust themselves entirely to Him."
And those who disbelieved said to their messengers, "We will certainly expel you from our territory, unless you reinstate our religion." Then their Lord revealed to them, "We will certainly destroy the unrighteous,
and settle you in the land after them. This is for him who fears My presence and fears My threat."
And they asked [Allah] for victory. And every insolent tyrant was disappointed.
Hell is his destination and he will be watered with purulent water
which he will try to swallow in small gulps. But he can barely swallow it. Death will come to him from all sides, but he will not die; and he will have a terrible punishment.
The works of those who have disbelieved in their Lord are like ashes violently struck by the wind on a stormy day. They will not benefit from what they have acquired. This is the profound bewilderment.
Do you not see that Allah created the heavens and the earth for a just reason? If He willed, He would make you disappear and bring in new creatures,
and this is not difficult for Allah.
And all of them will appear before Allah. Then the weak will say to those who were puffed up with pride: "We were indeed your followers. Can you be of any use to us against the punishment of Allah?" - Then others will say: "If Allah had guided us, we would certainly have guided you. It is indifferent for us to complain or to endure; we have no escape."
And when all is accomplished, the Devil will say: "Verily, Allah had promised you truth; while I made you a promise that I did not keep. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you answered me. Do not reproach me, then; but do it to yourselves. I am of no help to you, and you are of no help to me. I deny you that you once associated me [with Allah]." Verily, a painful punishment awaits the unrighteous [the associates].
And those who believe and do good works shall be brought into the gardens under which the streams flow, to dwell there forever, by the permission of their Lord. And there, their greeting will be: "Salam" (Peace).
Have you not seen how Allah offers a parable of a good word like a beautiful tree whose root is firm and its branches soaring into the sky?
He gives his fruits at all times, by the grace of his Lord. Allah offers parables for people to exhort each other.
And an evil word is like a bad tree, uprooted from the face of the earth and which has no stability.
Allah strengthens the believers with a firm word, both in this life and in the Hereafter. While He leads the unrighteous astray. And Allah does what He wills.
Do you not see those who trade the blessings of Allah for ingratitude and establish their people in the abode of perdition
... Hell, where they will burn? And what a bad lodging!
And they have given Allah equals in order to lead (people) astray from His path. - Say: "Enjoy [this life] for your destination will be fire."
Tell My servants who have believed, let them perform Salat and spend [in good] in secret and in public what We have allotted to them, before the day comes when there is no redemption or friendship.
Allah is the One who created the heavens and the earth and from heaven sent down water; thanks to which He has produced fruit to nourish you. He has placed in your service the ships which, by His command, sail on the sea. And He has made the rivers subject to your service.
And for you, He has subjected the sun and the moon to a perpetual revolution. And He has subdued you night and day.
He has granted you all that you have asked Him. And if you were to count the blessings of Allah, you would not be able to count them. The man is really very unjust, very ungrateful.
And (remember) when Abraham said, "O my Lord, make this city a safe place, and preserve me and my children from the worship of idols.
O my Lord, they (idols) have led many people astray. Whoever follows me is one of mine. As for the one who disobeys me... it is You, the Forgiving, the Most Merciful!
O our Lord, I have settled part of my descendants in a valley without agriculture, near Your sacred house [the Ka'ba], O our Lord, so that they may perform Salah. Therefore let the hearts of some of the people lean towards them. And feed them with fruit. Maybe they'll be grateful?
O our Lord, You truly know what we hide and what we divulge: - and nothing escapes Allah, neither on earth nor in heaven! -
Praise be to Allah, who in spite of my old age, has given me Ishmael and Isaac. Verily, my Lord hears prayers well.
O my Lord! Grant that I may diligently perform Salat as well as a part of my descendants; hear my prayer, O our Lord!
O our Lord! forgive me, my father and mother and the believers on the day of reckoning."
And do not think that Allah is inattentive to what the wrongdoers. They will give them a delay until the day when their eyes freeze.
They will run [supplicate], raising their heads, haggard eyes and empty hearts.
And warn the people of the day when the punishment will come upon them, and those who have been unjust will say, "O our Lord, grant us a short delay, and we will answer Your call and follow the messengers." - Didn't you swear before that you should never disappear?
And you have dwelt in the dwellings of those who have wronged themselves. It has become clear to you how We have dealt with them and We have given you the examples.
They certainly plotted. However, their plot is written with Allah even if their plot was powerful enough to make the mountains disappear...
Do not think that Allah is breaking His promise to His Messengers. Verily, Allah is Almighty and Possessor of the power to punish,
on the Day when the earth will be replaced by another, as well as the heavens, and (men) will appear before Allah, the One, the Supreme Ruler.
And on that day you will see the guilty, chained to each other,
their tunics will be of tar and fire will cover their faces.
(All this) so that Allah may reward each soul for what it has acquired. Verily, Allah is prompt in His reckoning.
This is a message (the Qur'an) for the people to be warned, to know that He is only one God, and for the intelligent to exhort each other.
Alif, Lâm, Râ. Here are the verses of the Book and of an explicit Reading.
[On the Day of Judgment] the disbelievers would like to have been Muslims.
Let them eat, enjoy (for a time), and be distracted by hope; for soon they will know!
Now We do not destroy any city unless it has had a known scripture.
No community anticipates its end, nor delays it.
And they (the Meccans) say: "O you on whom the Qur'an has been sent down, you are certainly mad!
Why did you not come to us with the angels, if you are of the truthful?"
We send down the angels only with the truth; and then they will not be given [these ungodly men] any respite.
Verily, it is We who sent down the Qur'an, and We are the custodians of it.
And we have sent [Messengers] before you among the peoples of the ancients.
And not a Messenger has come to them without their mocking it.
This is how We make (disbelief) penetrate into the hearts of the guilty.
They will not believe in him [the Messenger or the Qur'an] even though the traditional fate of the ancients has been fulfilled.
And even if We were to open a gate of heaven for them, and they could ascend to it,
they would say, "Truly our eyes are veiled. But rather, we are bewitched people."
Verily, We have placed constellations in the sky, and We have beautified it for those who look.
And We have protected him from every banished devil.
Unless one of them surreptitiously manages to listen, a bright flame then pursues him.
And as for the earth, We have spread it out and placed mountains on it, and have caused everything to grow in harmony proportion.
And We have placed in it food for you, and (placed also for you) beings that you do not feed.
And there is nothing of which We do not have the reserves, and We send it down only to a certain extent.
And We send forth the fertilizing winds; and then We send down from heaven water which We drink for you and which you are not able to preserve.
And it is We who give life and give death, and it is We who are the heir [of all].
And We certainly know those among you who have gone forward, and We know those who are still delaying.
Verily, it is your Lord who will gather them. For He is the Wise, the All-Knowing.
We created man from a crunchy clay, extracted from a malleable mud.
And as for the jinn, We had previously created him from a fire of fiery heat.
And when your Lord said to the angels, "I will create a man of crunching clay, extracted from malleable mud,
and as soon as I have harmoniously formed him and breathed into him My breath of life, then fall down prostrate before him."
Then the angels all prostrated themselves together,
except Iblis, who refused to be with the prostrate.
Then [Allah] said: "O Iblis, why are you not among the prostrate?"
He said, "I cannot bow down to a man whom You have created of crunching clay out of malleable mud."
- And [Allah] said: "Come out of this [Paradise], for you are banished!
And curse upon you, until the Day of Retribution!"
- He said, "O my Lord, give me a delay until the day when they (the people) are risen."
[Allah] said: "You are one of those to whom this delay is granted,
until the day of the known moment" [of Allah].
- He said, "O my Lord, because You have misled me, then I will beautify their life on earth and lead them all astray,
except, among them, Your chosen servants."
- "[Allah] says: This is a straight path [that leads] to Me.
Over My servants you shall have no authority, except over the one who follows you among the misguided.
And Hell will surely be the meeting place for all of them.
It has seven gates; and each door has its own determined share."
Certainly, the pious will be in gardens with springs.
"Enter in peace and security."
And We will have torn out all grudges from their breasts, and they will feel themselves brothers, facing one another on beds.
No fatigue will touch them. And they will not be taken out.
Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
and that My chastisement is indeed the painful chastisement.
And inform them about Abraham's guests
When they came to his house and said, "Salam," he said, "We are afraid of you."
They said, "Do not be afraid! We bring you good news, [the birth] of a boy full of knowledge."
He said, "Do you tell me [this news] when old age has touched me? What do you tell me?"
- They said, "We are telling you the truth. So do not be among those who despair."
- He said, "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, if not the erring?"
And he said to them: "What do you want, O messengers of Allah?"
- They said, "Verily, we are sent to sinful people,
with the exception of Lot's family, whom we will all save
except his wife. We (Allah) had determined that she would be among the exterminated.
Then when the envoys came to the family of Lot
he says, "You are strangers to me."
- They said, "Rather, we have come to you bringing (the punishment) about which they doubted.
And we come to you with the truth. And we are truthful.
Go with your family by night and follow their backs; and let none of you turn back. And go where you are commanded."
And We gave him this order, that in the morning these people shall be annihilated to the last.
And the inhabitants of the city (Sodom) came [to him] in joy.
- He said, "These are my guests, so do not dishonor me.
And fear Allah. And do not cover me with ignominy."
They said, "Didn't we forbid you to [receive] people?"
He said, "Here are my daughters, if you want to do something!"
By your life! they were confused in their delirium.
Then, at sunrise, the Cry (the catastrophe) seizes them.
And We overthrew [the city] from top to bottom, and rained upon them stones of hard clay.
This is really proof, for those who know how to observe!
It [this city] was on a path known to all.
This is truly an exhortation for believers!
And the people of al-Aika were [also] unrighteous.
So we took revenge on them. And these two [cities], really, are on a very obvious road [that you know].
Certainly, the people of al-Hijr called the messengers liars.
We showed them Our miracles, but they turned away from them.
And they carved houses in the mountains, living in safety.
Then, in the morning, the Scream seized them.
What they had acquired therefore did not profit them.
And We created the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, only for a just reason. And the Hour [without a doubt] will come! Forgive [them] therefore with a beautiful forgiveness.
Your Lord is truly the great Creator, the All-Knowing.
We have indeed given you "the seven verses that are repeated", as well as the sublime Qur'an.
Above all, do not look with envy at the things that We have given temporary enjoyment to some of them, do not grieve over them, and lower your wing for the believers.
And say, "I am the evident warner" (of a punishment),
As We have sent down [the punishment] on those who have sworn (among themselves),
those who have made the Qur'an into various fractions, (to create doubts).
By your Lord! We will question them all
on what they were doing.
Therefore make clear what you have been commanded to do, and turn away from the associates.
We have indeed defended you against the scoffers.
Those who associate Allah with another deity. But they will soon know.
And We know that your breast is clenched because of what they say.
Glorify your Lord therefore by His praise and be of those who bow down;
and worship your Lord until certainty comes to you.
Allah's command is coming. So don't hasten it. Glory be to Him! He is above what is associated with Him.
He sends down the Angels by His command, with the revelation about whom He wills among His servants: "Warn that there is no god but Me. Fear Me, then."
He created the heavens and the earth with good reason. It transcends what is associated with [Him].
He created man from a drop of semen; and now the man becomes an open disputant.
And the cattle He created for you; you get warm [clothes] from it as well as other benefits. And you eat it too.
They look beautiful when you bring them back in the evening, and also in the morning when you release them for grazing.
And they carry your burdens to a land that you would hardly reach. Truly, your Lord is Compassionate and Merciful.
And horses, mules, and donkeys, for you to ride, and for pageantry. And He creates what you don't know.
It is up to Allah to show the right path, for there are some who detach themselves from it. Now, if He willed, He'd guide you all.
It is He who has sent down water from heaven to drink you and to feed your flocks.
From it He causes crops to grow for you, olive trees, palm trees, vineyards and also all kinds of fruit. This is a proof for people who think.
For your sake He has subdued night and day; the sun and the moon. And to His command are the stars. These are proofs for people who reason.
What He has created for you on earth has various colors. This is a proof for people who remember.
And it is He who has subdued the sea so that you may eat fresh flesh from it, and take out of it ornaments that you wear. And you see the ships cleaving the sea with noise, so that you go in search of His grace and so that you can be thankful.
And He has set up motionless mountains in the earth so that it will not shake and take you with it, and rivers and paths, that you may be guided,
as well as landmarks. And by means of the stars [people] guide themselves.
Is he who creates like he who creates nothing? Don't you remember?
And if you count the blessings of Allah, you will not be able to count them. For Allah is Forgiving, and Merciful.
And Allah knows what you hide and what you divulge.
And those whom they invoke besides Allah create nothing, and they themselves are created.
They are dead, not alive, and they do not know when they will be resurrected.
Your God is one God. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts deny (the Oneness of Allah) and they are filled with pride.
There is no doubt that Allah knows what they hide and what they divulge. And assuredly He does not like the proud.
And when they are asked, "What has your Lord sent down?" They say, "Ancient legends!"
Let them, therefore, on the Day of Resurrection, bear all the burdens of their own works, as well as a part of the burdens of those whom they unknowingly lead astray; How bad is [the burden] they carry!
Those who lived before them, of course, plotted, but Allah attacked the very foundations of their building. The roof collapsed above them, and the punishment surprised them from where they had not sensed it.
Then on the Day of Resurrection, He will cover them with disgrace, and [them] will say, "Where are My associates for whom you were fighting?" - Those who have knowledge will say, "Shame and misfortune are falling on the disbelievers today."
Those whose lives are taken away by the angels, while they are unjust to themselves, will submit in humiliation, (and say): "We did no wrong!" - "But, in fact, Allah knows well what you were doing".
Enter therefore through the gates of Hell to dwell there forever. How bad is the dwelling of the proud!
And those who were pious will be asked, "What has your Lord sent down?" They will say, "A good." Those who do good works will have good here on earth; but the abode of the hereafter is certainly better. How pleasant will be the dwelling of the righteous!
The gardens of the (eternal) abode, where they will enter and under which the streams flow. They will have what they want there; this is how Allah rewards the righteous.
Those whose souls are taken back by the angels – even though they are good – [the angels say to them], "Peace be upon you! Enter Heaven for what you did."
Do they wait for the angels to come to them, or for the command of your Lord to come? This is how people acted before them. Allah has not wronged them; but they were doing harm to themselves.
The misdeeds they committed will reach them, and what they mocked will surround them on all sides.
And the associates said: "If Allah had willed, we would not have worshipped anything besides Him, neither we nor our ancestors; and we would not have forbidden anything that He had not forbidden Himself." This is how people acted before them. Is it not the responsibility of the messengers to convey the message clearly?
We have sent a Messenger to every Messenger, saying: "Worship Allah and depart from the Tagut." So Allah guided some of them, but there were some who were destined to go astray. Go through the earth, then, and see what was the end of those who called [Our Messengers] liars.
Even if you longed for them to be guided... [Know] that Allah does not guide those who go astray. And they won't have rescuers.
And they swear by Allah by pronouncing their most solemn oaths: "Allah will not raise up the one who dies." Quite the contrary! This is a true promise [from Him], but most people don't know it.
(He will raise them up) so that He may make clear to them what they differed from, and so that those who disbelieved would know that they were liars.
When We want something, Our only word is, "Be." And, it is.
And those who, for the sake of Allah, have emigrated after suffering injustices, We will put them in a pleasant position in this world's life. And the wages of the last life would be even greater if they knew.
They who have endured and placed their trust in their Lord.
We have sent before you only men to whom We have made revelations. So ask the callback people if you don't know.
(We sent them) with clear proofs and holy books. And to you, We sent down the Qur'an, so that you may make clear to the people what has been sent down for them, and so that they may reflect.
Are those who were plotting misdeeds safe from Allah swallowing them up in the ground or from coming to them the punishment from which they did not expect?
Or let Him seize them in the middle of their activity and they cannot escape (Allah's punishment).
Or that He seizes them in full terror? But truly, your Lord is Compassionate and Merciful.
Have they not seen that the shadows of all things that Allah has created lengthen to the right and to the left, prostrating themselves before Allah in all humility?
And it is before Allah that every living creature in the heavens and on the earth bows down; as well as the angels who are not puffed up with pride.
They fear their Lord, above them, and do what they are commanded.
Allah says: "Do not take two gods. He is only one God. Therefore, fear only Me."
To Him belongs what is in heaven and on earth; it is to Him that perpetual obedience is due. Would you then fear anyone other than Allah?
And whatever you have as a blessing comes from Allah. Then when misfortune befalls you, it is Him whom you implore aloud.
And when He has dispelled your misfortune, behold, some of you begin to give partners to their Lord,
thus disregarding what We have given them. Enjoy, then, [for a time!] Soon you'll know!
And they assign a portion [of the goods] which We have allotted to them to [idols] which they do not know. By Allah! You will certainly be questioned about what you were inventing.
And they assign daughters to Allah. Glory and purity be to Him! And to themselves, however, (they assign) what they desire (sons).
And when one of them is told of a girl, his face darkens and a deep rage [invades him].
He hides himself from people, because of the misfortune that has been announced to him. Should he keep it despite the shame or will he bury it in the ground? How bad is their judgment!
It is to those who do not believe in the Hereafter that the wrong adjective (which they have attributed to Allah) belongs. Whereas to Allah [Alone] is the supreme adjective. And He is the Almighty, the Wise.
If Allah were to go after people for their misdeeds, He would not leave any living beings on this earth. But He postpones them until a fixed time. Then, when their term comes, they can neither delay it by an hour nor bring it forward.
And they assign to Allah what they hate [for themselves]. And their tongues speak a lie when they say that the greatest reward will be reserved for them. It is the Fire, no doubt, that will be reserved for them, and they will be sent to it first.
By Allah! We have indeed sent (messengers) to communities before you. But the Devil embellished what they were doing. He is the one who is their ally today [in this world]. And they will have a painful punishment [in the Hereafter].
And We have sent down the Book upon you only so that you may clearly show them the reason for their dissension, as well as a guide and a mercy for believing people.
Allah sent down water from heaven with which He revives the earth after his death. This is really proof for people who hear.
Verily, there is a teaching for you in the cattle: We drink you with what is in their bellies, - [a product] extracted from the [mixture] of [intestinal] excrement and blood - pure milk, delicious for drinkers.
From the fruits of the palm trees and vines, you get an intoxicating drink and an excellent food. This is really a sign for people who reason.
[And this] is what your Lord revealed to the bees: "Take dwellings in the mountains, and in the trees, and in the trellises that [men] make.
Then eat of every kind of fruit, and follow the paths of your Lord, which have been made easy for you. From their bellies comes a liquor, of various colors, in which there is a healing for people. This is really proof for people who think.
Allah created you! Then He will put you to death. One of you will be led back to the vilest age, so that after he has known, he comes to know nothing. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.
Allah has favored some of you over others in [the distribution] of His gifts. Those who have been favored are in no way disposed to give their share to those whom they possess by right [slaves] to the point that they become equal partners in them. Will they deny the blessings of Allah?
Allah has made you wives from yourselves, and from your wives He has given you children and grandchildren. And He has attributed good things to you. Do they believe in falsehood, and deny the blessing of Allah?
And they worship besides Allah that which cannot provide them with any food from the heavens and the earth, and is capable of nothing.
So do not attribute to Allah like them. For Allah knows, but you do not know.
Allah offers in a parable a slave belonging to [his master], devoid of all power, and a man to whom We have granted a good allocation from Us, which he spends in secret and in public. Are [these two men] equal? Praise be to Allah! But most of them don't know.
And Allah proposes in a parable two men: one of them is dumb, devoid of all power and totally dependent on his master; Wherever the latter sends him, he brings nothing good; Would he be the equal of him who ordains justice and is on the right path?
To Allah belongs the unknowable of the heavens and the earth. And the order of the Hour will be only as a wink or even briefer! For Allah is indeed Omnipotent.
And Allah has brought you out of your mothers' wombs, destitute of all knowledge, and has given you hearing, eyes, and hearts, so that you; Be grateful.
Have they not seen the birds subject in the atmosphere of the sky without anything holding them back except Allah? There is really evidence there for people who believe.
And Allah has made your houses a dwelling, just as He has provided you with houses made of animal skins that you find light, on the day you move and the day you camp. Of their wool, their hair and their hair (He has procured for you) effects and articles which you enjoy for a certain time.
And from what He has created, Allah has provided you with shadows. And He has provided you with shelter in the mountains. And He has provided you with clothing that protects you from the heat, as well as clothing [breastplates, armor] that protects you from your own violence. This is how Allah completes His blessing on you, perhaps you submit.
If they turn away... it is only your responsibility to communicate clearly.
They acknowledge the blessing of Allah; then they deny it. And most of them are ungrateful.
(And remember) on the Day when from every community We raise up a witness, the infidels will not be allowed (to apologize), nor will they be asked to go back [on what provoked the wrath of Allah].
And when the unrighteous see the punishment, they will not be given relief or respite.
When the associates see those whom they associated with Allah, they will say: "O our Lord, these are our gods whom we invoked apart from You." But [their associates] will say to them, "You are certainly liars."
On that day they will offer Allah submission, and what they have invented will be lost to them.
Those who did not believe and obstructed the cause of Allah, We will add to them punishment upon punishment, for the corruption they sowed (on earth).
And on the Day when in every community We will raise up a witness from among themselves against them, and We will take you [Muhammad] as a witness against them. And We have sent down upon you the Book as an explicit exposition of all things, and as a guide, a grace, and a good proclamation to the Muslims.
Verily, Allah commands fairness, beneficence, and assistance to relatives. And He forbids turpitude, wrongdoing, and rebellion. He exhorts you to remember.
Be faithful to Allah's covenant after you have made it, and do not violate your oaths after you have solemnly taken them and taken Allah as your guarantor. Truly Allah knows what you are doing!
And do not be like the one who undid her distaff strand by strand after she had spun it solidly, taking your oaths as a means to deceive one another, because (you have found) one community stronger and more numerous than the other. Allah only tests you. And verily, He will make it clear to you on the Day of Resurrection what you were opposing on.
If Allah had willed, He would have made you one nation. But He lets whomever He wills go astray and guides whom He wills. And you will certainly be questioned about what you were doing.
And do not take your oaths as a means to deceive one another, otherwise [your] steps will slip after they have been firm, and you will taste misfortune for standing in the way of Allah. And you will suffer a terrible punishment.
And do not sell Allah's pact at a low price. What is with Allah is better for you, if you knew!
All that you possess will be exhausted, while that which is with Allah will endure. And We will reward those who have been consistent according to the best of what they have done.
Whoever, male or female, does a good deed while being a believer, We will make him live a good life. And We will reward them, indeed, according to the best of their deeds.
When you read the Qur'an, ask for Allah's protection from the banished Devil.
He has no power over those who believe and trust in their Lord.
He has power only over those who take him as an ally and who become associates because of him.
When We replace one verse with another – and Allah knows best what He is sending down – they say, "You are just a liar." But most of them don't know.
Say: "It is the Holy Spirit [Gabriel] who sent him down from your Lord in all truth, in order to strengthen [the faith] of those who believe, and to be a guide and good news for the Muslims."
And We know perfectly well that they say: "It is only a human being who teaches him (the Qur'an)". Now the language of the one to whom they refer is foreign [non-Arabic], and this is a very clear Arabic language.
Those who do not believe in the verses of Allah, Allah does not guide them. And they have a painful punishment.
Only those who do not believe in the verses of Allah forge lies; and such are the liars.
Whoever has denied Allah after believing - except the one who has been forced to do so while his heart remains full of the serenity of faith - but those who deliberately open their hearts to disbelief, they have the wrath of Allah upon them and they have a terrible punishment.
This is so, because they loved the present life more than the hereafter. And Allah, indeed, does not guide disbelievers.
These are the ones whose hearts, hearings, and eyes Allah has sealed. They are the carefree ones.
And there is no doubt that in the afterlife, they will be the losers.
As for those who have emigrated after having undergone trials, then struggled and endured, your Lord after this is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
(Remember) the day when every soul will come, pleading for themselves, and every soul will be fully rewarded for what they have done without suffering the slightest injustice.
And Allah proposes in a parable a city: it was safe, quiet; his share of food came to him from everywhere in abundance. Then she showed herself ungrateful to the blessings of Allah. Allah then made him taste the violence of hunger and fear [as punishment] for what they were doing.
Indeed, a Messenger of their own came to them, but they called him a liar. Punishment, therefore, seizes them because they were unjust.
Eat therefore of what Allah has given you that is lawful and good. And be thankful for the blessings of Allah, if it is Him whom you worship.
He has forbidden you (the flesh) of the dead animal, the blood, the flesh of a pig, and the beast on which a name other than that of Allah has been invoked. But whoever eats it under duress, and is neither a rebel nor a transgressor, then Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And do not say, in accordance with the lies spoken by your tongues, "This is lawful, and this is unlawful," to forge a lie against Allah. Verily, those who forge a lie against Allah will not succeed.
It will be a pitiful enjoyment for them, but a painful punishment awaits them.
To the Jews We forbade what We have already told you. We have done them no wrong; but they were doing themselves a disservice.
Then your Lord towards those who have committed evil through ignorance, and have subsequently repented and improved their conduct, your Lord, after that is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.
Abraham was a perfect guide ('Umma). He was subject to Allah, dedicated exclusively to Him, and he was not one of the associates.
He was grateful for His bounty and Allah had chosen him and guided him to a straight path.
We have given it a good share here below. And he will certainly be in the Hereafter of the number of good people.
Then We revealed to you: "Follow the religion of Abraham, who was dedicated exclusively to Allah and was not among the associates."
The Sabbath was imposed only on those who differed about it. On the Day of Resurrection, your Lord will certainly judge about what they differed from.
By wisdom and good exhortation call (people) to the path of your Lord. And discuss with them in the best way. For it is your Lord who knows best the one who strays from His path, and it is He who knows best those who are rightly guided.
And if you punish, inflict [on the aggressor] a punishment equal to the wrong he has done you. And if you endure... This is certainly better for those who have endurance.
Endure! Your endurance will come only with (the help) of Allah. Do not grieve for them. And don't be distressed because of their plots.
Verily, Allah is with those who have feared [Him] with piety and those who are beneficent.
Glory and Purity to Him who made His servant [Muhammad] travel by night from the Mosque of Al-Haram to the Mosque of Al-Aqsa, the surroundings of which We have blessed, in order that He may see some of Our wonders. It is He, truly, who is the Hearer, the Clairvoyant.
And We gave Moses the Book that We made a guide for the Children of Israel: "Take no protector besides Me."
[O you], the descendants of those whom We carried in the ark with Noah. He was truly a very grateful servant.
We had decreed for the Children of Israel, (and announced) in the Book: "Twice you will sow corruption on the earth and you will transgress excessively."
When the fulfillment of the first of these two [predictions] came, We sent against you some of Our servants endowed with terrible strength, who entered into the interior of the mansions. And the prediction was fulfilled.
Then We gave you revenge on them; and We strengthened you in goods and children. And We made you more numerous:
"If you do good; you do it to yourselves; and if you do evil, you do it to yourself [also]." Then when the last [prediction] came, it was that they should afflict your faces and enter the Mosque as they had entered it the first time, and that they might completely destroy what they had seized.
It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you. But if you reoffend, We will reoffend. And We have assigned Hell as a detention camp for the infidels.
Verily, this Qur'an guides to what is most right, and it announces to believers who do good deeds that they will have a great reward,
and to those who do not believe in the Hereafter, that We have prepared a painful punishment for them.
Man calls evil as he calls good, for man is very hasty.
We have made night and day two signs, and We have blotted out the sign of night, while We have made the sign of the day visible, so that you may seek graces from your Lord, and know the number of years and the reckoning of time. And We have explained everything in detail.
And to the neck of every man We have fastened his work. And on the Day of Resurrection, We will bring out to him a writing which he will find unfolded:
"Read your writing. Today, you just have to be your own accountant."
Whoever takes the right path takes it only for himself; and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to his own detriment. And no one will bear the burden of another. And We have never punished [a people] until We have sent a Messenger.
And when We want to destroy a city, We command its wealthy people [to obey Our prescriptions], but (on the contrary) they give themselves up to perversity. Then the Word spoken against it is fulfilled, and We destroy it entirely.
How many generations have we exterminated, after Noah! And your Lord is sufficient that He is Perfectly Knower and Clear-Sighted about the sins of His servants.
Whoever desires [life] immediately, We hasten to give what We want, to whom We will. Then We assign him Hell, where he will burn, despised and rejected.
And those who seek the hereafter and make the efforts that lead to it, while being believers... then the effort of these will be recognized.
We grant abundantly to all, these as well as these, gifts from your Lord. And the gifts of your Lord are not withheld [to anyone].
Look at how we favor some over others. And in the afterlife, there are higher and more privileged ranks.
Do not assign to Allah any other god; otherwise you will find yourself despised and abandoned.
And your Lord has decreed, "Worship only Him; and (mark) kindness to the father and mother: if one or both of them should reach old age with you, then do not say to them, "Fi!" and do not rush them, but speak to them with respectful words.
and out of mercy lower the wing of humility for them, and say, "O my Lord, have mercy on them both, as they have raised me when I was a child."
Your Lord knows best what is in your souls. If you are good, He is certainly Forgiving for those who return to Him in repentance.
"And give to the next of kin what is due to him and to the poor and to the traveler (in distress). And do not waste unduly,
for the wasters are the brothers of the devils; and the Devil is very ungrateful to his Lord.
If you turn away from them in search of your Lord's mercy, which you hope for, speak a kind word to them.
Do not put your hand in chains around your neck [out of avarice], nor stretch it out too wide, or you will find yourself blamed and grieved.
Verily, your Lord extends His gifts widely to what He wills or grants them sparingly. He is, over His servants, Perfectly Knower and Clear-sighted.
And don't kill your children for fear of poverty; We are the ones who assign their sustenance, just as to you. Killing them is really a huge sin.
And do not approach fornication. In truth, it is a turpitude and what a bad path!
And except in law, do not kill the life that Allah has made sacred. Whoever is killed unjustly, then We have given power to his relative. Let him not commit excess in murder, for he is already assisted (by the law).
And approach the property of the orphan only in the best way, until he reaches his majority. And fulfill the pledge, for one will be asked about the pledges.
And give the full measure when you measure, and weigh with an accurate scale. It's better [for you] and the result will be better.
And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Hearing, sight, and heart: on all this, in truth, one will be questioned.
And do not tread the earth with pride: you will never know how to split the earth and you will never be able to reach the height of the mountains.
What is evil in all this is hated by your Lord.
All this is part of what your Lord has revealed to you about Wisdom. So do not assign any other god to Allah, or you will be thrown into Hell, blamed and rejected.
Would your Lord have reserved sons for you and taken daughters for Himself from among the angels? You are speaking a monstrous word.
Most certainly We have set forth [all this] in this Qur'an so that [people] may think. But this only increases their revulsion.
Say: "If there were gods with Him, as they say, then they would have sought a way [to reach] the Throne Holder."
Purity to Him! He is higher and infinitely above what they say!
The seven heavens and the earth and those in them celebrate His glory. And there is nothing that does not celebrate His glory and praise. But you don't understand how they glorify Him. Surely it is He who is Forgiving and Forgiving.
And when you read the Qur'an, We place an invisible veil between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter,
We have put veils over their hearts, so that they do not understand it: and in their ears, a heaviness. And when, in the Qur'an, you mention Your Lord the One, they turn their backs out of revulsion.
We know very well what they are listening to. When they listen to you and whisper among themselves, the unrighteous say, "You follow only a bewitched man."
See what they're comparing you to! So they go astray and are unable to find a way (to the truth).
And they say, "When we are bones and dust, will we be raised in a new creation?"
Say: "Be stone or iron.
or any other creature you can conceive." Then they will say, "Who will bring us back?" – say, "He who created you the first time." They will shake their heads at you and say, "When is this?" Say: "It may be near.
On the day He calls you, you will respond to Him by glorifying Him. But you will think that you have only stayed [on earth] for a short time!"
And tell My servants to express the best words, for the Devil sows discord among them. The Devil is certainly a declared enemy for man.
Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He will show you mercy, and if He wills, He will punish you. And We have not sent you to be their protector.
And your Lord is more Knower than those who are in heaven and on earth. And among the prophets, We have given more favors to some than to others. And to David We gave the "Zabur."
Say: "Call upon those whom you pretend, (to be gods) besides Him. They possess neither the means of dispelling your misfortune nor of diverting it.
Those whom they invoke seek [themselves], who are the best they can, the means of drawing nearer to their Lord. They hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement. The punishment of your Lord is truly feared.
There is no city that We do not destroy before the Day of Resurrection, or that We do not punish with severe punishment. This is well traced in the Book [of Immutable Decrees].
Nothing prevents Us from sending miracles, except that the ancients called them lies. We brought to the Thamûd the she-camel, which was a visible [miracle]: but they wronged him. Moreover, We send miracles only as a threat.
And when We told you that your Lord encircles all people (by His power and knowledge). As for the vision that We have shown you, We have only made it to test people, just like the cursed tree mentioned in the Qur'an. We threaten them, but this only increases their great transgression.
And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they prostrated themselves, except for Iblis, who said, "Shall I prostrate myself before one whom You have created of clay?"
He said again, "See? He whom You have honored above me, if You give me respite until the Day of Resurrection, I will certainly test his descendants except a few [among them]."
And [Allah] said: "Go away! Whoever of them will follow you... your punishment will be Hell, ample retribution.
Stir up those among them whom you can by your voice, gather your cavalry and infantry against them, associate with them in their property and their children, and make promises to them." Now the Devil makes promises to them only in deception.
As for My servants, you have no power over them." And your Lord is enough to protect them!
Your Lord is the One who sails the ship for you at sea, that you may go in search of some grace from Him; Verily He is merciful to you,
And when evil touches you at sea, those whom you invoked apart from Him are lost. Then, when He saves you and brings you back to shore, you turn away. The man remains very ungrateful!
Are you safe from the fact that He will swallow you up by a piece of earth, or that He will send a hurricane against you (with rain in stones) and that you will then find no protector?
Or are you safe from bringing you back to the sea another time, and unleashing one of these winds against you, and then drowning you because of your disbelief? And then you will find no one to defend you against Us!
Verily, We have honored the sons of Adam. We have transported them by land and sea, have given them good things for food, and We have clearly preferred them to many of Our creatures.
On the Day when We call each group of men by their leader, those who are given their book in their right hand will read their book (with pleasure) and will not suffer the slightest injustice.
And whoever is blind here on earth will be blind in the hereafter, and will be more misguided in the right way.
They almost turned you away from what We had revealed to you, [in the hope] that instead of this, you would invent something else and (impute it) to Us. And then they would have taken you as an intimate friend.
And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost bowed a little to them.
Then We would certainly have made you taste the double [torment] of life and the double [torment] of death; and then you would not have found a helper against Us.
In truth, they almost made you flee the country and banish you. But in that case, they wouldn't have stayed there long after you.
This was the rule applied by Us to Our messengers whom We sent before you. And you will not find any change in Our rule.
Perform Salat at the setting of the sun until the darkness of the night, and also at dawn, for the Reading at dawn has witnesses.
And of the night dedicate a part [before dawn] to voluntary salah: so that your Lord may raise you up in a position of glory.
And say, "O my Lord, let me enter by an entrance of truth and go out by an exit of truth; and grant me power from You that is helped by You."
And say: "The Truth (Islam) has come and the Error has disappeared. For Error is destined to disappear."
We send down from the Qur'an, which is healing and mercy for believers. However, this only increases the perdition of the unrighteous.
And when We shower man with blessings, he turns away and withdraws into himself; and when an evil touches him, he is profoundly desperate.
Say: "Each one acts according to his own method, while your Lord knows best who follows the best way."
And they ask you about the soul, say, "The soul belongs to the order of my Lord." And you have been given little knowledge.
If We will, We can certainly make disappear what We have revealed to you; and you would find no defender against Us in it afterwards.
Except by the mercy of your Lord, for indeed His grace upon you is great.
Say: "Even if men and jinn were to unite to produce something like this Qur'an, they would not be able to produce anything like this, even if they supported each other."
And verily, We have displayed all kinds of examples for the people in this Qur'an. But most people persist in being disbelievers.
And they said, "We will not believe in you until you have caused a spring to spring up for us out of the earth;
or that you have a garden of palm trees and vines, between which you will cause streams to gush forth in abundance;
or that you cause the sky to fall on us, as you pretend, in pieces; or that you bring Allah and the angels before us;
or that you have a house [garnished] with ornaments; or that you have ascended to heaven. Yet we will not believe in your ascension into heaven until you send down upon us a Book that we can read." Say to them, "Glory be to my Lord! Am I just a human being-Messenger?"
And nothing prevented the people from believing, when the guide came to them, except that they said: "Does Allah send a human being as a Messenger?"
Say: "If there were angels walking quietly on earth, We would have sent down an Angel Messenger to them from heaven."
Say: "Allah is sufficient as a witness between you and me." He is, over His servants, Perfectly Knower and Clear-sighted.
The one whom Allah guides is the right-guided and those whom He leads astray... you will never find them allies besides Him, and on the Day of Resurrection We will gather them dragged over their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf. Hell will be their dwelling place: whenever its fire weakens, We will increase the burning flame for them.
This will be their punishment because they do not believe in Our proofs and say, "When we are bones and dust, will we be resurrected in a new creation?"
Have they not seen that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create their like? He has set a time for them, about which there is no doubt, but the unrighteous persist in their disbelief.
Say: "If you were the ones who possessed the treasures of my Lord's mercy, you would certainly skimp for fear of spending them. And man is very miserly!
And verily, We gave Moses nine evident miracles. Ask the Children of Israel, when he came to them and Pharaoh said to him, "O Moses, I think you are bewitched."
He said, "You know very well that these things [miracles] only the Lord of heaven and earth has sent down as so many illuminating proofs; and indeed, O Pharaoh, I believe you to be lost."
So [Pharaoh] wanted to expel them from the land. Then We drowned them all, he and those who were with him.
And after him We said to the Children of Israel, "Dwell in the land." Then, when the promise of the last (life) comes, We will bring you in crowds.
And it is in all truth that We sent it down (the Qur'an), and with the truth it came down, and We sent you only as a herald and a warner.
(We have sent down) a Qur'an that We have fragmented, so that you can read it slowly to the people. And We have brought it down gradually.
Say: "Believe it or don't believe it. Those to whom knowledge has been given before this, when it is recited to them, fall prostrate, with their chins to the ground
and say, "Glory to our Lord! Our Lord's promise is certainly fulfilled."
And they fall on their chins, weeping, and this increases their humility.
Say: "Call upon Allah, or invoke the Most Merciful. Whatever you call Him by, He has the most beautiful names. And in your Salah, do not recite aloud; and do not lower it too much, but seek the golden mean between the two."
And say: "Praise be to Allah, who has never given Himself a child, who has no partner in the kingdom, and who has never had a protector of humiliation." And loudly proclaims His greatness.
Praise be to Allaah, who sent down the Book upon His servant (Muhammad) and did not introduce any wrongness into it.
[A Book] of perfect righteousness to warn of severe punishment from Him and to announce to believers who do good deeds that there will be a great reward for them.
where they will dwell forever,
and to warn those who say: "Allah has given Himself a child."
Neither they nor their ancestors know anything about it. What a monstrous word is that which comes from their mouths! What they say is a lie.
You may be consumed with grief because they turn away from you and don't believe in this speech!
We have placed what is on the earth to beautify it, in order to test (men and to know) which of them are the best in their actions.
Then We will surely transform its surface into an arid soil.
Do you think that the people of the Cave and of ar-Raquîm were an extraordinary thing among Our wonders?
When the young men had taken refuge in the cave, they said, "O our Lord, give us mercy from You; and assure us of righteousness in everything that concerns us."
So We deafened their ears in the cave for many years.
Then We resurrected them, in order to know which of the two groups would best calculate the exact length of their stay.
We will tell you their story in all truth. They are young men who believed in their Lord; and We have granted them the greatest means of directing themselves [in the right way].
We strengthened their hearts when they stood up to say, "Our Lord is the Lord of heaven and earth: we will never call upon any god besides Him, or we shall transgress in our words.
Behold, our fellow citizens have adopted divinities besides Him. Why do they not bring clear proof of them? Who is more unrighteous than the one who invents a lie against Allah?
And when you have separated yourselves from them and from what they worship besides Allah, take refuge in the cave, and your Lord will pour out His mercy on you and will bring a softening of your fate to you.
You would have seen the sun, when it rises, move away from their cave to the right, and when it sets, pass to their left, while they themselves are there in a spacious part (of the cave)... This is one of the wonders of Allah. The one whom Allah guides, he is the rightly guided. And whoever He leads astray, then you will find no ally for Him to put Him on the right path.
And you would have thought them awake, while they are sleeping. And We turn them to the right side and to the left side, while their dog is at the entrance with legs extended. If you had seen them, you would certainly have turned your back on them as you fled; and you would certainly have been filled with terror before them.
And so We raised them up, so that they might ask one another. One of them said, "How long did you stay there?" They said, "We have stayed a day or part of a day." Others said, "Your Lord knows best how long you have dwelt there. Send one of you to the city with this money, so that he may see what food is the purest and bring you food to eat. Let him act with tact; and let him not awaken anyone about you.
If they ever catch you, they will stone you or make you return to their religion, and then you will never succeed again."
And so We caused them to be discovered, so that they [the people of the city] might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there should be no doubt about the Hour. So they argued about them and said, "Build a building over them. Their Lord knows them best." But those who prevailed said, "Let us build a sanctuary over them."
They will say: "There were three of them and the fourth was their dog". And they will say by conjecturing on their mystery that they were five, the sixth being their dog and they will say, "seven, the eighth being their dog." Say: "My Lord knows their number best. There are only a few who know this." Discusses them only in an apparent way and does not consult anyone about them.
And never say, about a thing, "I'll surely do it tomorrow,"
without adding: "Allah willing," and call upon your Lord when you forget and say, "I wish that my Lord would guide me and lead me closer to what is right."
Now they remained in their cave three hundred years and added nine (years).
Say: "Allah knows best how long they stayed there. To Him belongs the Unknowable of the heavens and the earth. How Seer and Hearer He is! They have no allies besides Him, and He does not associate anyone with His command.
And recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. No one can change His words. And you will find no refuge apart from Him.
Be patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and night, desiring His Face. And let not thy eyes detach themselves from them, seeking (the false) brilliance of life on earth. And do not obey Him whose hearts We have made inattentive to Our Reminder, who pursues his passion and whose behavior is outrageous.
And say, "The truth emanates from your Lord." Whoever wants it, let him believe, whoever wants it, let him disbelieve." We have prepared for the unrighteous a Fire whose flames surround them. And if they beg for a drink, they will be watered with water like molten metal, burning their faces. What a bad drink and what a detestable dwelling!
Those who believe and do good deeds... truly We do not let the reward of him who does good be lost.
These are the ones who will have the gardens of the (eternal) abode under which the streams flow. They will be adorned with gold bracelets and will dress in green clothes of fine silk and brocade, leaning on couches (well decorated). What a good reward and what a beautiful house!
Give them the example of two men: to one of them We have assigned two gardens of vines, which We have surrounded with palm trees, and We have placed cultivated fields between the two gardens.
The two gardens produced their harvest without ever failing. And We have caused a stream to gush forth between them.
And he had fruit and then said to his companion with whom he was conversing: "I have more goods than you, and I am more powerful than you because of my clan."
He went into his garden guilty of himself [by his disbelief]; he says, "I don't think this can ever perish,
and I don't think the Hour will come. And if I am brought back to my Lord, I will certainly find a better place to return than this garden.
His companion said to him, while conversing with him, "Are you a disbeliever towards Him who created you from earth, then from semen, and finally fashioned you into a man?
As for me, Allah is my Lord; and I associate no one with my Lord.
When you enter your garden, why do you not say: "This is the will (and grace) of Allah! There is no power except through Allah." If you see me less provided than you in goods and children,
it may be that my Lord will soon give me something better than your garden, that He will send some calamity to your garden from heaven, and that its ground will become slippery,
or let its water dry up so that you can no longer find it."
And his crop was destroyed, and he began to wring both his hands because of what he had spent on it, while his trellises were completely destroyed. And he said, "How I wish I had associated no one with my Lord."
He had no group of people to help him against Allah. And he could not help himself.
In this case, the sovereign protection belongs to Allah, the True. It gives the best reward and the best result.
And offer them the example of life here on earth. It is like water which We send down from heaven; the vegetation of the earth mixes with it. Then it becomes parched grass that the winds scatter. Verily, Allah is Mighty in all things.
Property and children are the ornament of the life of this world. However, good works that persist have a better reward with your Lord and [arouse] good hope.
The Day when We will make the mountains move and you will see the earth levelled (like a plain) and We will gather them together without omitting a single one.
And they will be presented in rows before your Lord. "You have come to Us as We created you the first time. Yet you claimed that We would not fulfill Our promises."
And we will put down the book (of each). Then you will see the criminals, frightened because of what is in it, say: "Woe to us, what is the matter with this book that does not omit to mention either venial or capital sin?" And they will find before them all that they have worked. And your Lord does not harm anyone.
And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they prostrated themselves, except Iblis [Satan] who was of the jinn and rebelled against the command of his Lord. Are you going to take him and his descendants as allies besides Me, when they are enemies to you? What a bad exchange for the unjust!
I did not take them as witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of the creation of their own persons. And I have not taken as helpers those who go astray.
And the day He says, "Call those whom you claimed to be My associates." They will invoke them; but they will not answer them, for We will have placed between them a valley of perdition.
And criminals will see Fire. They will then be convinced that they will fall into it and will not find a way out.
And certainly, We have displayed for the people in this Qur'an all kinds of examples. Man, however, is the greatest disputant of all beings.
What, then, prevented the people from believing, when the guide came to them, and from asking forgiveness from their Lord, except that they want to suffer the fate of the ancients, or to come face to face with the punishment?
And We send messengers only to preach the good news and warn. And those who have disbelieved argue with false arguments, in order to invalidate the truth, and mock My verses (the Qur'an) and that (punishment) of which they have been warned.
Who is more unjust than he who was reminded of the verses of his Lord and turned his back away from them, forgetting what his two hands have done? We have placed veils over their hearts, so that they do not understand (the Qur'an), and put a heaviness in their ears. Even if you call them to the right path, they will never be able to guide themselves.
And your Lord is the Forgiver, the Holder of mercy. If He were to attack them for what they have acquired, He would certainly hasten their punishment. But there is a fixed time for them (for the fulfillment of threats) from which they will find no refuge.
And these are the cities that We destroyed when their people committed injustices, and We set a date for their destruction.
(Remember) when Moses said to his servant, "I will not stop until I have reached the confluence of the two seas, even if I walk for many years."
Then, when they had both reached the confluence, they forgot their fish, which then took its way freely into the sea.
And when they had both passed [this place,] he said to his servant, "Bring us our breakfast, for we have met with fatigue in our present journey."
[The valet] said, "When we took refuge by the rock, you see, I forgot the fish - the Devil alone made me forget to remind you of it - and it curiously made its way into the sea."
[Moses] said, "This is what we were looking for." Then they retraced their steps, following in their footsteps.
They found one of Our servants to whom We had given a grace from Us and to whom We had taught a science from Us.
Moses said to him, "May I follow you, if you teach me what you have been taught about good leadership?"
[The other] said, "Really, you can never be patient with me.
How can you endure things that you do not embrace by your knowledge?"
[Moses] said to him, "Allah willing, you will find me patient; and I will not disobey any of your commands."
"If you follow me," said [the other], "do not ask me about anything until I have mentioned it to you."
So the two of them left. And after they had boarded a boat, the man made a breach in it. [Moses] said to him, "Have you chipped it to drown its occupants? You have certainly committed a monstrous thing!"
[The other] replied, "Did I not say that you could not have patience with me?"
"Do not blame me," said [Moses,] "for an oversight on my part; and does not impose any great difficulty on me in my business."
Then they both departed; and when they met a child, [the man] killed him. Then [Moses] said to him, "Have you killed an innocent being, who has not killed anyone? You have certainly committed a dreadful thing!"
[The other] said to him, "Didn't I tell you that you couldn't be patient with me?"
"If, after this, I ask you about anything," said [Moses], "then don't go with me anymore. You will then be excused for parting with me."
So they both set out; and when they came to an inhabited village, they asked for food from its inhabitants; but the latter refused to give them hospitality. Then they found a wall on the verge of collapse. The man straightened it up. Then [Moses] said to him, "If you wanted, you could have asked for a salary for it."
"This [marks] the separation between you and me," said [the man,] "I will teach you the interpretation of what you have not been able to bear with patience.
As for the boat, it belonged to poor people who worked at sea. I therefore wanted to make it defective, for there was a king behind them who seized every boat by force.
As for the boy, his father and mother were believers; we feared that he would impose rebellion and disbelief on them.
We have therefore willed that their Lord should grant them in exchange another purer and more affectionate.
And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphaned boys of the city, and there was a treasure of theirs underneath; and their father was a virtuous man. Therefore your Lord has willed that both of them should come of age, and that they should extract their treasure by the mercy of your Lord. I didn't do it on my own. This is the interpretation of what you have not been able to endure with patience."
And they ask you about Dul-Qarnayn. Say: "I will tell you some memorable facts about it."
Truly, We have established His power on earth, and We have given Him free rein to all things.
So he followed a path.
And when he had reached the sunset, he found that the sun was setting in a muddy spring, and near it he found an ungodly tribe. We said, "O Dul-Qarnayn! either you chastise them, or you use benevolence towards them".
He said, "As for the one who is unjust, we will punish him; then he will be brought back to his Lord who will punish him with a terrible punishment.
And as for the one who believes and does a good deed, he will have the greatest reward in return. And we will give him orders that are easy to execute."
Then he followed (another) path.
And when he reached the east, he found that the sun was rising over a tribe to which We had not given a veil to protect themselves.
This was the case, and We embrace with Our Science what he held.
Then he followed (another) path.
And when he had reached a place between the Two Barriers (mountains), he found behind them a tribe that understood almost no language.
They said, "O Dul-Qarnayn, the Ya Juj and the Ma Juj are making a mess on earth. Will we be able to pay tribute to you to build a barrier between them and us?"
He said, "What My Lord has bestowed upon me is better (than your gifts). So help me with your strength and I will build an embankment between you and them.
Bring me iron blocks." Then, when he had filled up the space between the two mountains, he said, "Blow!" Then, when he had returned it to a furnace, he said, "Bring me molten copper, and I may pour it on it."
Thus, they could hardly climb or chip it either.
He said, "It's a mercy from my Lord. But when my Lord's promise comes, He will level it. And the promise of my Lord is truth."
We will let them break like the waves on that day, and the trumpet will be blown and gathered together.
And on that day We will present Hell to the disbelievers,
whose eyes were covered with a veil that prevented them from thinking of Me, and they could not hear anything either.
Do those who have disbelieved expect to be able to take My servants apart from Me as allies? We have prepared Hell as a residence for the disbelievers.
Say: "Do you want Us to tell you who are the biggest losers, in works?
Those whose effort in this life has gone astray, when they imagine they are doing good.
Those who denied the signs of their Lord, as well as His meeting. Their actions are therefore in vain." We will not assign them weight on the Day of Resurrection.
It is because their retribution will be Hell, for having disbelieved and mocked My signs (teachings) and My messengers.
Those who believe and do good works will have for their residence the Gardens of the "Firdaws" (Paradise),
where they will dwell forever, without desiring any change.
Say: "If the sea were ink [to write] the words of my Lord, surely the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We were to bring him his equivalent as a reinforcement."
Say: "I'm actually a human being like you. It has been revealed to me that your God is one God! Whosoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him do good deeds and not associate in his worship any other with his Lord."
Kâf, Hâ', Yâ', 'Aîn, Sâd.
It is a record of your Lord's mercy toward His servant Zechariah.
When he invoked his Lord with a secret invocation,
and said, "O my Lord, my bones are weak, and my head is inflamed with white hairs. [However], I have never been unhappy [disappointed] in praying to you, O my Lord.
I fear [the behavior] of my heirs, after me. And my own wife is barren. Give me a descendant from You
who inherits from me and inherits from the family of Jacob. And make it acceptable to you, O my Lord."
"O Zechariah, We preach to you the good news of a son. His name will be Yahya [John]. We have not previously given it a namesake."
And [Zechariah said], "O my Lord, how shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I am far advanced in old age?"
[Allah] said to him: "So it will be! Your Lord said, "This is easy for me. And before that, I created you when you were nothing."
"O my Lord," says [Zechariah], "grant me a sign." "Your sign," says [Allah,] "will be that you will not be able to talk to people for three nights while being well.
So he went out of the sanctuary to his people; then he made a sign to them to pray morning and evening.
... "O Yahya, hold fast to the Book (the Torah)!" We gave him wisdom when he was a child,
as well as the tenderness of Us and purity. He was pious,
and devoted to his father and mother; and was neither violent nor disobedient.
Peace be upon him on the day he was born, the day he dies, and the day he is raised alive.
Mentioned in the Book (the Qur'an), Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place towards the East.
She put a veil between herself and them. We sent her Our Spirit (Gabriel), who presented himself to her in the form of a perfect man.
She said, "I take refuge from you with the Most Merciful. If you are pious, [do not come near me]."
He says, "I am in fact a Messenger of your Lord to give you a pure son."
She said, "How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, and I am not a prostitute?"
He said, "So it will be! It is easy for Me, your Lord has said. And We will make him a sign to the people, and a mercy from Us. It's a matter already decided."
So she became pregnant [with the child], and she withdrew with him to a distant place.
Then the pangs of childbirth brought her to the trunk of the palm tree, and she said, "Woe to me! That I had died before that moment! And that I was totally forgotten!"
Then he called her from below her, [saying:] "Do not grieve. Your Lord has placed a spring at your feet.
Shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you, and it will cause fresh and ripe dates to fall on you.
Eat and drink, and let your eye rejoice! If you see any of men, say to him, "Surely I have vowed a fast to the Most Merciful, so I will not speak to any human being today."
Then she came to her family carrying him [the baby]. They said, "O Mary, you have done a monstrous thing!
"Sister of Harun, your father was not a man of evil and your mother was not a prostitute."
She then made a sign to him [the baby]. They said, "How shall we speak to a baby in the cradle?"
But (the baby) said, "I am truly the servant of Allah. He gave me the Book and designated me a prophet.
Wherever I am, He has blessed me; and He has recommended to me, as long as I live, prayer and Zakat;
and kindness to my mother. He didn't make me violent or unhappy.
And peace be upon me on the day I was born, and on the day I die, and on the day I am raised alive."
Such is Issa (Jesus), son of Mary: word of truth, of which they doubt.
It is not fitting for Allah to attribute a son to Himself. Glory and Purity be to Him! When He decides on something, He just says, "Be," and it is.
Verily, Allah is my Lord just like your Lord. Worship him, then. This is a straight path."
[Subsequently,] the sects diverged among themselves. So, woe to the disbelievers at the sight of a terrible day!
How well they will hear and see the day when they come to Us! But today, the unrighteous are in an obvious error.
And warn them of the day of Regret, when all will be settled; while they are inattentive and do not believe.
Verily, We will inherit the earth and all that is on it, and to Us they will be returned.
And mentioned in the Book, Abraham. He was a very truthful and prophet.
When he said to his father, "O my father, why do you worship that which neither hears nor sees, and does not profit you in anything?
O my father, it has come to me from knowledge that which thou hast not received; follow me, therefore, and I will guide you to a straight path.
O my father, do not worship the Devil, for the Devil disobeys the Most Merciful.
O my father, I fear that a punishment from the Most Merciful will come upon you and that you will become an ally of the Devil."
He said, "O Abraham, would you have any disdain for my gods? If you do not cease, I will stone you, and depart from me for a long time."
"Peace be upon you," says Abraham. "I will implore my Lord to forgive you because He has always showered me with His blessings.
I separate myself from you and from what you call upon besides Allah, and I will call upon my Lord. I hope I am not unhappy in my call to my Lord."
And when he had separated himself from them and from what they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob; and of each One We made a prophet.
And We gave them by Our mercy, and granted them a sublime language of truth.
And mentions in the Book Moses. He was truly a chosen one, and he was a Messenger and a prophet.
From the right side of Mount (Sinai) We called him and brought him up as a confidant.
And by Our mercy We gave him Aaron his brother as a prophet.
And mentions Ishmael in the Book. He was faithful to his promises; and he was a Messenger and a prophet.
And he commanded his family to pray and Zakat; and he was accepted with his Lord.
And mentions Idris, in the Book. He was a truthful man and a prophet.
And We raised him to a high station.
These are those whom Allah has bestowed favors on among the prophets, among the descendants of Adam, and also among those whom We carried with Noah, and among the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and among those whom We have guided and chosen. When the verses of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they fell prostrate and wept.
Then they were succeeded by generations who abandoned prayer and followed their passions. They will find themselves in perdition,
except the one who repents, believes, and does good: these will enter Paradise and will not be wronged,
to the gardens of the (eternal) abode which the Most Merciful promised to His servants, [who believed] in the mystery. For His promise will undoubtedly come.
No insignificant words are heard in it; only: "Salâm"; and there they will have their food, morning and evening.
This is the Paradise from which We will inherit those of Our servants who have been pious.
"We do not descend except by order of your Lord. To Him all that is before us, all that is behind us, and all that is in between. Your Lord forgets nothing.
He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them. Worship Him, therefore, and be steadfast in His worship. Do you know a homonym for him?"
And the man said, "When I'm dead, will they take me out alive?"
Does not man remember that before that, We created him, when he was nothing?
By your Lord! Assuredly, We will gather them and the devils. Then We will place them around Hell, kneeling.
Then We will uproot from each group those of them who were most obstinate against the Most Merciful.
Then we are the best at knowing the ones who most deserve to be burned there.
There is no one among you who will not pass through [Hell]: for [this is] an irrevocable sentence for your Lord.
Then We will deliver those who were pious and leave the unrighteous on their knees.
And when Our obvious verses are recited to them, the disbelievers say to those who believe, "Which of the two groups has the more comfortable situation and the better company?"
How many generations have We destroyed before them, which surpassed them in good things and appearances?
Say: "Whoever is in error, let the Most Merciful prolong his life for a certain time, until they see either the punishment or the Hour with which they are threatened. Then they will know who has the worst situation and the weakest troop."
Allah increases the righteousness of those who follow the right path, and lasting good deeds merit a better reward and destination with your Lord.
Have you seen the one who does not believe in Our verses and says, "They will certainly give me property and children"?
Is he aware of the Unknowable or has he made a commitment to the Most Merciful?
Quite the contrary! We will record what he says and increase his punishment.
It is We who will inherit what he speaks of, while he will come to Us alone.
They have adopted deities besides Allah to be protectors of them.
Quite the contrary! [these deities] will deny their worship and will be adversaries to them.
Have you not seen that We have sent devils against the disbelievers who are furiously stirring them up?
Do not therefore be hasty against them: We keep a precise account of [all their deeds].
(Remember) the Day when We gather the pious on horses and with great pomp to the Most Merciful,
and drive the criminals to Hell as (a flock) to the watering-place,
they will have no intercession, except the one who has made a commitment with the Most Merciful.
And they said, "The Most Merciful has given Himself a child."
You are certainly saying an abominable thing here!
The heavens are very far from opening at these words, and the earth is splitting, and the mountains are falling,
because they have assigned a child to the Most Merciful,
when it is by no means fitting for the Most Merciful to have a child!
All who are in heaven and on earth will go to the Most Merciful, [without exception], as servants.
He has certainly counted them and counted them well.
And on the Day of Resurrection, each of them will go to Him alone.
To those who believe and do good works, the All-Merciful will bestow His love.
We have made it (the Qur'an) easy [to understand] in your language, so that you may preach the good news to the righteous people through it, and warn an irreconcilable people.
How many generations before them have We destroyed them! Do you find a single individual? Or do you hear the slightest whisper of it?
Tâ-Hâ.
We have not sent down the Qur'an upon you to make you miserable,
if it is only a reminder to the one who fears (Allah),
(and as) a revelation from Him who created the earth and the sublime heavens.
The Most Merciful has established Himself "Istawâ" on the Throne.
To Him belongs what is in the heavens, on the earth, what is between them and what is under the damp ground.
And if you lift up your voice, He certainly knows the secrets, even the most hidden.
Allah! No divinity but Him! It has the most beautiful names.
Has the account of Moses come to you?
When he saw fire, he said to his family, "Stay here! I see fire from afar; perhaps I will bring you a brand, or I will find something to guide me by the fire."
Then, when he arrived there, he was challenged: "Moses!
I am your Lord. Take off your sandals, for you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa.
I have chosen you. Listen therefore to what is about to be revealed.
Verily, it is I Allah: there is no god but Me. Worship Me, therefore, and perform Salat to remember Me.
The Hour will certainly arrive. I hardly hide it, so that each soul may be rewarded according to his efforts.
Let not those who do not believe in it and follow their own passion turn away from it. Otherwise you will perish.
And what's in your right hand, O Moses?"
He said: "It is my stick on which I lean, which I use to leaf (the trees) for my sheep and I use it for other purposes."
[Allah] said to him: "Throw it away, O Moses."
He threw it away, and behold, a serpent crawling.
[Allah] says: "Take hold of him and do not be afraid: We will bring him back to his former state.
And clasp your hand under your armpit, and it will come out white without any harm, and this will be another wonder,
so that We may show you Our most important wonders.
Go to Pharaoh because he has exceeded all limits.
[Moses] said, "Lord, open my breast to me,
and facilitates my mission,
and untie a knot in my tongue,
that they may understand my words,
and assign me an assistant from my family:
Aaron my brother,
increase my strength through him!
and associate him with my mission,
that we may glorify You much,
and that we call upon You a lot.
And you are very clear of us."
[Allah] said: "Your request is granted, O Moses.
And We have already favored you the first time
when We revealed to your mother what was revealed:
"Put it in the casket, and then throw it into the waves, and then the river throws it on the shore; an enemy of Mine and of him will take him." And I have poured out upon you an affection from Me, that you may be lifted up under My eye.
And your sister followed you walking and said, "Can I tell you someone who will take care of him?" So We brought you back to your mother, so that her eye might rejoice and she might not grieve any more. You then killed a person; We saved you from the fears that oppressed you; and We imposed many trials on you. Then you stayed for years with the inhabitants of Madyan. Then you came, O Moses, according to a decree.
And I have assigned you to Myself.
Go with My wonders, you and your brother; and do not neglect to call upon Me.
Go to Pharaoh: he really rebelled.
Then, talk to him nicely. Maybe he will remember or fear [Me]?"
They said, "O our Lord, we fear that he will mistreat us unduly, or that he will go beyond the bounds."
He said, "Fear not. I am with you: I hear and I see.
Go to him, then; Then say to him, "We are both messengers of your Lord. Send the Children of Israel to our company and punish them no more. We have come to you with a proof from your Lord. And peace be upon everyone who follows the right path!
It has been revealed to us that the punishment is for those who refuse to have faith and turn their backs."
Then [Pharaoh] said, "Who is your Lord, O Moses?"
"Our Lord," says Moses, "is the One who gave to each thing its own nature and then directed it."
"What then of the older generations?" said Pharaoh.
Moses said, "The knowledge of their fate is with my Lord in a book. My Lord [makes] no error or forgetfulness.
It is He who has assigned the earth to you as a cradle and has traced paths for you in it; and who from heaven sent down water with which We cause to germinate pairs of plants of all kinds."
"Eat and graze your cattle." These are signs for the intelligent.
From it (the earth) We created you, and in it We will return you, and from it We will bring you out once more.
Verily We have shown him all Our wonders; but he denied them and refused (to believe).
He said, "Have you come to us, O Moses, to bring us out of our land by your magic?
We will certainly bring you similar magic. Appoint a meeting between us and you that neither we nor you will miss, in a suitable place."
Then Moses said, "Your appointment is on the feast day. And that people gather in the morning."
Pharaoh, therefore, withdrew. Then he gathered his cunning and came (to the rendezvous).
Moses said to them, "Woe to you! Do not forge a lie against Allah, or He will destroy you with punishment. He who forges (a lie) is lost."
Thereupon they began to dispute among themselves about their affair, and kept their discussions secret.
They said, "Here are two magicians who, by their magic, want to make you abandon your land and carry away your ideal doctrine.
So gather your cunning and then come in tight rows. And whoever comes out on top today will have succeeded."
They said, "O Moses, either do you throw [your staff first] or let us be the first to throw?"
He said, "Throw it away." And now their ropes and sticks seemed to him to creep by the effect of their magic.
Moses felt some fear within himself.
We told him, "Don't be afraid, you will have the upper hand.
Throw away what is in your right hand; it will devour what they have made. What they have made is only a magician's trick; and the magician does not succeed, wherever he is."
The magicians fell down in prostration, saying, "We have faith in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."
Then Pharaoh said, "Did you believe in him before I allowed you to do so? He is your leader who taught you magic. I will surely have you cut off opposite hands and legs, and crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will know for sure which of us is stronger in punishment and which is the most lasting."
"By Him who created us," they said, "we will never prefer you to what has come down to us as clear proofs. Decree, therefore, what you have to decree. Your decrees affect only this present life.
We believe in our Lord, so that He will forgive us our sins and the magic to which you have forced us." And Allah is better and eternal.
Whoever comes as a criminal to his Lord, will certainly have Hell where he neither dies nor lives.
And whoever comes to Him believing, after having done good deeds, these are the ones who will have the highest ranks,
the gardens of the (eternal) abode, under which the streams flow, where they will dwell forever. And this is the reward of those who purify themselves [from disbelief and sins].
We revealed to Moses, "Go out at night at the head of My servants, and then make a dry passage for them in the sea, without fear of pursuit, and without fear."
Pharaoh pursued them with his armies. The sea did indeed submerge them.
Pharaoh thus led his people astray and did not set them on the right path.
O Children of Israel, We have already delivered you from your enemy, and We have appointed you to meet on the right side of the Mount. And We have sent down manna and quail upon you.
"Eat of the good things that We have bestowed upon you, and do not be ungrateful, or My wrath will fall upon you: and whoever My wrath falls upon is surely going to the abyss.
And I am the Great Forgiver to the one who repents, believes, does good work, and then sets out on the right path."
"Why did you hasten to leave your people, Moses?"
They are there in my footsteps, says Moses. And I hastened to You, Lord, that You might be pleased.
Allah said: "We have put your people to the test after you have left. And the Sâmirî has led them astray."
So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved; he said, "O my people, has not your Lord already made you a fine promise? So was the alliance too long for you? or have you desired that the wrath of your Lord should fall upon you, for having betrayed your pledge to me?"
They said, "It is not of our own free will that we have failed in our commitment to you. But we were laden with burdens of ornaments of the people (of Pharaoh); so we threw them (on the fire) just as the Sâmirî threw them.
Then he brought out for them a calf, a body with a roar. And they said, "That's your god and the godhead of Moses; so he forgot"!
What! Did they not see that he [the calf] did not give them any words and that he had no means of harming them or doing them good?
Aaron had said to them before, "O my people, you have fallen into temptation (because of the calf). Now it is the Most Merciful who is truly your Lord. Follow me, therefore, and obey my command."
They said, "We will continue to be attached to it until Moses returns to us."
Then [Moses] said, "What prevented you, Aaron, when you saw them go astray,
to follow me? Have you then disobeyed my command?"
[Aaron] said, "O son of my mother, do not take me by the beard or by the head. I was afraid that you would say, "You divided the children of Israel and did not keep my commands."
Then [Moses] said, "What was your purpose? O Sâmirî?"
He said, "I have seen what they have not seen, so I have taken a handful of the trace of the Messenger; Then I threw it. This is what my soul has suggested to me."
"Go away," said [Moses]. In life, you'll have to say (to everyone), "Don't touch me!" And there will be an appointment for you that you cannot miss. Look at your divinity whom you have assiduously worshipped. We will certainly burn it, and then we will scatter [its ashes] in the waves.
Verily, your only God is Allah, besides whom there is no god. Of His knowledge He embraces everything.
This is how We tell you the stories of what happened. It is indeed a reminder from Us that We have brought you.
Whoever turns away from it (from this Qur'an), will bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection;
they will remain in this state forever, and what a bad burden for them on the Day of Resurrection,
On the Day when the Trunk is blown, on that Day We will gather the criminals all blue (with fear)!
They will whisper to each other, "You were only here ten [days]!"
We know perfectly well what they will say when one of them, whose conduct is exemplary, says: "You have only stayed for one day".
And they ask you about the mountains. Say: "My Lord will scatter them like dust,
and will leave them like a bare plain
in which you will see neither tortuosity nor depression.
On that day, they will follow the Convener without tortuosity; and voices will bow before the Most Merciful. Then you will only hear a whisper.
On that day, intercession will benefit only the one to whom the Most Merciful has given His permission and whose word He accepts.
He knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they themselves do not understand Him with their knowledge.
And faces will humble themselves before the Living One, the Self-Subsisting One "al-Qayyûm," and woe will be he who [will appear before Him] burdened with iniquity.
And whoever has done good deeds while being a believer will not fear injustice or oppression.
Thus We sent down a Qur'an in Arabic, and We multiplied threats in it, so that they would become pious or it would encourage them to exhort each other.
May Allah, the True Ruler, be exalted. Do not hasten the Qur'an until it has been revealed to you. And say, "O my Lord, increase my knowledge."
For We have previously given a counsel to Adam; but he forgot; and We have not found in him a firm resolution.
And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they prostrated themselves, except Iblis, who refused.
Then We said, "O Adam, this one is indeed an enemy to you and your wife. Take care that he takes you out of Paradise, for then you will be unhappy.
For you will not hunger or be naked,
you will not thirst there nor be struck by the heat of the sun."
Then the Devil tempted him, saying, "O Adam, shall I point out to you the tree of eternity and an imperishable kingdom?"
Both of them (Adam and Eve) ate of it. Then their nakedness appeared to them. They began to cover themselves with leaves of paradise. Adam thus disobeyed his Lord and went astray.
His Lord then elected him, accepted his repentance, and guided him.
He said, "Come down from here, (Adam and Eve), [You will be] all (with your descendants) enemies of one another. Then, if ever a guide comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guide will not go astray or be miserable.
And whoever turns away from My Remembrance, will indeed lead a life full of embarrassment, and on the Day of Resurrection We will bring him blind to the gathering."
He'll say, "O my Lord, why did You bring me blind when I could see before?"
[Allah] will say to him: "As Our Signs (teachings) came to you and you have forgotten them, so today you are forgotten."
Thus we punish the outrageous who does not believe in the revelations of his Lord. And certainly, the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting.
Has it not served as a direction for them that We have destroyed before them so many generations in whose mansions they now walk? These are lessons for those endowed with intelligence!
Had it not been for a previous decree of your Lord, and also a term already fixed, (their punishment) would have been inevitable (and immediate).
Bear patiently with what they say and praise His praise, before sunrise, before sunset, and during the night; and exalts His glory at the ends of the day. Maybe you'll be satisfied:
And do not turn your eyes to that which We have given temporary enjoyment to certain groups of them, as a backdrop to the present life, in order to test them by it. What Allah provides (in Paradise) is better and more lasting.
And command your family to be salah, and do it with perseverance. We do not ask you for food, but it is for Us to feed you. The good end is reserved for piety.
And they say, "Why doesn't he bring us a miracle from his Lord? Has not the Proof (the Qur'an) of what is contained in the ancient Scriptures come to them?
And if We had put them to death by punishment before him [Muhammad], they would certainly have said, "O our Lord, why did You not send us a Messenger? Then we would have followed Your teachings before we were humbled and cast into ignominy."
Say: "Everyone is waiting. Wait! You will soon know who are the right people and who are the rightly guided."
[The deadline] for the settlement of their account is approaching for men, while in their carelessness they turn away from it.
No recent reminder [of revelation] comes to them from their Lord, unless they hear it in amusement,
their distracted hearts; and the unrighteous hold secret conversations and say, "Is this just a human being like you? Are you going to indulge in magic when you see clearly?"
He replied, "My Lord knows all that is said in heaven and on earth; and He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing."
But they said, "This is a heap of dreams! Or He invented it. Or, he's more of a poet. Let him therefore bring us a sign [identical] with which the first envoys were charged."
Not one of the cities which We destroyed before them believed [at the sight of miracles]. Will they believe?
We have sent before you only men to whom We made revelations. Ask the scholars of the Book, if you don't know.
And We did not make them bodies that did not consume food. And they were not eternal.
Then We fulfilled the promise (made to them). We saved them with those whom We wished to save. And We put to death the outrageous.
We have certainly sent down to you a book containing your memory [or your fame]. Don't you understand?
And how many cities that have committed injustices, We have broken; and We have created other peoples after them.
When [these people] felt Our rigor, they fled hastily.
Do not gallop. Rather, return to the great luxury where you were and to your homes, that you may be questioned.
They said, "Woe to us! We were really unfair."
Such was their lamentation until We had reaped and extinguished them.
It is not for fun that We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them.
If We had wanted to take a distraction, We would have taken it of Our own accord, if We really wanted to do it.
On the contrary, We hurl against the false the truth that subjugates it, and there it disappears. And woe to you for what you attribute [unjustly to Allah].
To Him alone belong all those who are in heaven and on earth. Those who are with Him [the Angels] do not consider themselves too great to worship Him, nor do they tire of it.
They exalt His glory night and day and do not stop.
Have they taken deities who can raise (the dead) from the earth?
If there were gods in heaven and earth other than Allah, both would be in disorder. Glory, therefore, to Allah, Lord of the Throne; He is above what they attribute to Him!
He is not questioned about what He does, but they are the ones who will have to give an account.
Did they take deities apart from Him? Say: "Bring your proof." This is the revelation of those who are with me and of those who were before me. But most of them do not know the truth and deviate from it.
And We have not sent any Messenger before you to whom We have not revealed: "There is no god but Me. Worship Me, then."
And they said, "The Most Merciful has given himself a child." Purity to Him! But they are rather honored servants.
They do not anticipate His Commandment and act according to His commands.
He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them. And they intercede only on behalf of those whom He has accepted [while being] imbued with His fear.
And whoever of them would say, "I'm a god besides Him." We will repay him from Hell. This is how We reward the wrongdoers.
Did not those who disbelieved see that the heavens and the earth formed a compact mass? Then We separated them and made water every living thing. Will they not believe?
And We have set firm mountains in the earth, that it may not be shaken by dragging them down. And We have placed defiles on them to serve as paths so that they can guide each other.
And We have made heaven a protected roof. And yet they turn away from its wonders.
And it is He who created night and day, the sun and the moon; each one sailing in an orbit.
And We have not attributed immortality to any man before you. If you die, will they be eternal?
Every soul must taste death. We will try you with evil and with good [as] a temptation. And it is to Us that you will be brought back.
When the disbelievers see you, they only mock you (saying): "What! Is this the one who speaks ill of your gods?" And they deny [any] reminder of the Most Merciful.
Man was created prompt in his nature. I will show you My signs [the fulfillment of My threats]. Do not hasten me, then.
And they say, "When will this promise be made, if you are truthful?"
If only the disbelievers knew the time when they would not be able to prevent the fire from their faces and backs, and when they would not be helped.
But no, it will come to them suddenly and they will be amazed; they will not be able to repel him and they will not be given a break.
Messengers who came before you have been mocked. And those who mocked them were struck on all sides by the very object of their mockery.
Say: "Who protects you night and day from the [chastisement] of the Most Merciful?" Yet they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord.
Do they then have deities besides Us who can protect them? But they can neither help themselves nor be assisted against Us.
On the contrary, We have granted [temporary] enjoyment to these as to their ancestors until an advanced age. Do they not see that We are coming to the earth, which We are reducing on all sides? Will they then be the winners?
Say: "I warn you by what is revealed to me." The deaf, however, do not hear the call when they are warned.
If a breath of your Lord's chastisement touched them, then they would say, "Woe to us! We were really unfair."
On the Day of Resurrection, We will set the right scales. No soul will be harmed in anything, even by the weight of a mustard seed that We will bring in. We are more than enough to draw up the accounts.
We have already brought to Moses and Aaron the Book of Discernment (the Torah) and a light and a reminder for the righteous,
who fear their Lord even though they do not see Him, and fear the Hour (the end of the world).
And this [the Qur'an] is a blessed reminder that We have sent down. Are you going to deny him?
Indeed, We have previously put Abraham on the right path. And We were well aware of it.
When he said to his father and his people, "What are these statues to which you are attached?"
they said, "We found our ancestors worshipping them."
He says, "Surely you and your ancestors have been in a manifest error."
They said, "Are you coming to us with the truth, or are you joking?"
He said, "But your Lord is rather the Lord of heaven and earth, and He created them. And I am one of those who testify to this.
And by Allah! I will certainly be cunning against your idols once you are gone."
He tore them to pieces, except for the largest [statue]. Maybe they would come back to her.
They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He is certainly among the unjust."
(Some) said, "We have heard a young man speak ill of them; his name is Abraham."
They said, "Bring him before the eyes of the people so that they can testify.
(Then) they said, "Is it you who did this to our gods, Abraham?"
He said, "This is the greatest of them that has done it. Ask them, then, if they can speak."
Then they changed their minds and said to one another, "You are the truly unrighteous."
Then they turned around and said, "You know very well that these do not speak."
He said: "Worship yourselves, then, apart from Allah, which can neither benefit nor harm you.
Forget you and what you worship besides Allah! Are you not reasoning?"
They said, "Burn it. Help your gods if you want to do something (for them)."
We said, "O fire, be a salutary freshness to Abraham."
They wanted to cunning against him, but it was they whom We made the greatest losers.
And We rescued him and Lot to a land which We had blessed for the whole universe.
And We gave him Isaac and, moreover, Jacob, whom We made good men.
We made them leaders who guided by Our order. And We revealed to them to do good, to perform the prayer, and to pay Zakat. And they were Our worshippers.
And Lot! We have brought him the ability to judge and to know it, and We have saved him from the city where vices were committed; These people were really evil people, perverts.
and We have brought him into Our mercy. He was truly one of the good people.
And Noah, when he called before. We heard him and saved him and his family from great anguish,
and We helped him against the people who treated Our wonders as lies. They were truly people of evil. So we drowned them all.
And David, and Solomon, when they had to judge about a cultivated field where some sheep belonging to a tribe had gone to graze at night. And We witnessed their judgment.
We made it clear to Solomon. And to each We gave the faculty of judgment and knowledge. And We enslaved the mountains to exalt Our glory with David, as well as the birds. And We are the Doer.
We taught him (David) how to make chainmail so that it would protect you from your mutual violence (war). So are you grateful for that?
And (We subdued) to Solomon the rushing wind which, by his command, went to the land which We had blessed. And We are able to know everything,
and among the devils there were some who dived for him and did other work, and We watched over them Ourselves.
And Job, when he implored his Lord, said: "Evil has touched me. But you are the most merciful of the merciful"!
We heard him, took away the evil he had, restored to him his own and as much as they did with them, out of mercy on Our part and as a reminder to the worshippers.
And Ishmael, Idris, and Dûl-Kifl! who were all enduring;
whom We brought into Our mercy, for they were truly of the good.
And Dû'n-Nûn (Jonah) when he left, angry. He thought that We were not going to test him. Then he made the following call in the darkness: "No god but You! Purity to You! I was truly among the unjust."
We heard him and saved him from his anguish. And this is how We save believers.
And Zechariah, when he implored his Lord, "Do not leave me alone, Lord, when You are the best of heirs."
We heard him, gave him Yahya, and healed his wife. They worked together for good and invoked Us out of love and fear. And they were humble before Us.
And the one [the virgin Mary] who had preserved her chastity! We breathed into her a breath (of life) from Us and made her and her son a sign [miracle] for the universe.
Certainly, this community of yours is a unique community, and I am your Lord. Worship Me, then.
They have divided into sects. But all will return to Us.
Whoever does good deeds while believing, his effort will not be disregarded, and We record it for him.
It is forbidden [the inhabitants] of a city that We have destroyed to return [to the life of this world]!
Until the Yajuj and the Majuj are released and they rush from every height;
it is then that the true promise will draw near, while the eyes of those who have disbelieved are fixed: "Woe to us! We have been inattentive to this. Moreover, we were unjust."
"You and what you worshipped besides Allah will be the fuel of Hell, you will all go there.
If these were really divinities, they would not enter it; and all will dwell there forever.
They will groan in it, and hear nothing.
Those who were previously promised handsome rewards from Us will be excluded.
They will not hear his hissing and will enjoy eternally what their souls desire.
The great terror will not afflict them, and the Angels will welcome them: "This is the day that has been promised to you."
The day when We will fold the sky as one folds the roll of books. Just as We began the first creation, so We will repeat it; it is a promise that is incumbent upon Us and We will fulfill it!
And We have indeed written in the Zabur, after having mentioned it (in the Heavenly Book), that the earth will be inherited by My good servants."
In this [these teachings] there is a communication to a people of worshippers!
And We have sent you only in mercy for the universe.
Say: "This is what is revealed to me: Your God is one God; Are you submissive?" [determined to embrace Islam]
If they then turn away, then say, "I have warned you in all fairness; I do not know whether what is promised to you is near or far.
He knows what you say out loud and what you hide.
And I don't know; This may be a temptation for you and a pleasure for a while"!
He said, "Lord, judge in all justice! And Our Lord, the Most Merciful, it is He whose help is implored against your assertions."
O men! Fear your Lord. The earthquake [that will precede] the Hour is a terrible thing.
On the day you see him, every nurse will forget what she was suckling, and every pregnant female will abort what she was wearing. And you will see people drunk, when they are not. But Allah's punishment is harsh.
And there are people who argue about Allah without any knowledge, and who follow every rebellious devil.
It has been ordained with regard to the latter that he shall lead astray whoever takes him as his master, and that he shall guide him to the punishment of the furnace.
O men! If you doubt about the Resurrection, It is We Who created you from earth, then from a drop of semen, then from an adhesion, then from a [normally] formed as well as formless embryo to show you [Our Omnipotence] and We will deposit in the wombs what We want until a fixed term. Then We will take you out of you as a baby, so that you may then reach maturity. There are some among you who die [young] while others reach the lowest of years, so that they no longer know anything of what they knew before. In the same way you see the parched earth: as soon as We bring water down into it, it stirs up, swells, and causes all kinds of splendid pairs of vegetables to grow.
This is so because Allah is the truth; and it is He who restores life to the dead; and it is He who is Omnipotent.
And that the Hour will come; There is no doubt about it, and that Allah will raise up those who are in the tombs.
However, there are people who argue about Allah without any knowledge, no guide, and no Book to enlighten them.
displaying a proud attitude to lead people astray from the path of Allah. To him is the ignominy here below; and We will make Him taste the Day of Resurrection, the punishment of the furnace.
This is what your two hands have prepared (here below)! However, Allah is not unjust to His servants.
There are some people who worship Allah marginally. If anything good happens to them, they are at ease, and if a trial happens to them, they turn away their faces, thus losing (the good) of the here and hereafter. Such is the obvious loss!
They supplicate apart from Allah, which can neither harm nor benefit them. Such is the profound delusion!
They invoke what evil is certainly closer to than usefulness. What a bad ally, and what a bad companion!
Those who believe and do good deeds, Allah brings them into the Gardens under which the streams flow, for Allah does what He wills.
Whoever thinks that Allah will not help him in this world and in the Hereafter, let him stretch a rope to heaven and cut it, and see if his cunning will make what enrages him disappear.
This is how We sent it down in clear verses and Allah guides whomever He wills.
Verily, those who believed, the Jews, the Sabaeans, the Nazarenes, the Magi, and those who give Allah partners, Allah will decide between them on the Day of Judgment, for Allah is indeed the witness of all things.
Have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and all those who are on the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the animals, and many people, bow down to Allah? There are also many who deserve punishment. And whoever degrades Allah has no one to honor him, for Allah does what He wills.
Here are two opposing clans who were arguing about their Lord. To those who do not believe, they will cut clothes of fire, while boiling water will be poured over their heads,
who will melt what is in their bellies as well as their skins.
And there will be iron mallets for them.
Whenever they want to get out of it (to escape) distress, they are to be put back into it and (it is said to them): "Taste the punishment of the Furnace.
Verily, Allah introduces those who believe and do good deeds to the Gardens under which the streams flow. There they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and also with pearls; and their garments shall be of silk.
They were guided to the good word and they were guided to the path of the Worthy of praise.
But those who disbelieve and obstruct the path of Allah and the path of the Holy Mosque, which We have established for the people, both residents and those passing through... Whoever seeks to commit a sacrilege unjustly, We will make him taste a painful punishment,
And when We pointed out for Abraham the place of the House (the Kaaba) [saying to him]: "Do not associate anything with Me; and purify My House for those who walk around it, for those who stand in it, and for those who bow and bow down in it."
And make an announcement to the people for the Hajj. They will come to you on foot, and also on every horse, coming from every distant way,
to share in the benefits bestowed upon them and to invoke the name of Allah on the appointed days, over the livestock that He has assigned to them, "Eat of it yourselves and make the needy wretch eat it.
Then let them put an end to their prohibitions (cleanse their bodies), let them fulfill their vows, and let them make the circuits around the Ancient House."
This is what must be observed, and whoever holds the sacred limits of Allah in high regard, it will be better for him with his Lord. Cattle, except what you have been told, have been made lawful for you. Abstain from the defilement of idols and abstain from lying words.
Exclusively [be committed to the religion] of Allah, do not associate anything with Him; for whoever associates with Allah is as if he fell from the sky and the birds caught him, or the wind threw him into a very deep abyss.
This is [what is prescribed]. And whoever exalts the sacred injunctions of Allah, is indeed inspired by the piety of hearts.
[From these beasts] you derive advantages until a fixed term; then his place of immolation is near the Ancient House.
We have assigned a sacrificial rite to each of our communities, so that they may pronounce the name of Allah on the livestock that He has assigned to them. Your God is indeed a unique God. Submit therefore to Him. And give good news to those who humble themselves,
those whose hearts tremble when the name of Allah is mentioned, those who endure what comes to them, and those who perform Salah and spend what We have allotted to them.
We have appointed for you healthy camels (and cows) for certain rites established by Allah. There is a good in them for you. Therefore pronounce the name of Allah upon them, when they have had their paws tied, [ready to be slain]. Then, when they lie on their sides, eat of them, and feed them to the discreet needy and the beggar. So We have made them subject to you so that you may be grateful.
Neither their flesh nor their blood will reach Allah, but what affects Him from you is piety. Thus He has subdued them to you so that you may proclaim the greatness of Allah, for having set you on the right path. And proclaims the good news to the beneficents.
Allah defends those who believe. Allah does not love any ungrateful traitor.
Permission is given to those who are attacked (to defend themselves) - because they are really wronged; and Allah is indeed able to help them.
those who were expelled from their homes, - against all justice, simply because they said, "Allah is our Lord." - If Allah did not repel people one by one, the hermitages would be demolished, as well as the churches, synagogues and mosques where the name of Allah is invoked a lot. Verily, Allah supports those who uphold (His Religion). Verily, Allah is Mighty and Mighty,
those who, if We give them power on earth, perform Salah, pay Zakat, ordain what is proper, and forbid what is blameworthy. However, the final outcome of all things belongs to Allah.
And if they call you a liar, [know that] the people of Noah, the 'Aad, the Tamûd before them, also cried falsehood,
as well as the people of Abraham, the people of Lot.
and the people of Madyan. And Moses was called a liar. Then I gave respite to the disbelievers; then I took them. And what was My reprobation!
How many cities, then, have We put to death, because they committed tyrannies. They are reduced to collapsed roofs: what deserted wells! How many palaces have been built (and deserted too)!
Why do they not travel on earth that they may have hearts to understand, and ears to hear? For it is not the eyes that are blinded, but the hearts in the breasts that are blinded.
And they ask you to hasten [the coming] of the chastisement. Allah will never fail in His promise. However, one day with your Lord is equivalent to a thousand years of what you count.
How many cities have I not given respite when they committed tyrannies? Then I grabbed them. To Me is becoming.
Say: "O men! I am only an explicit warning to you."
Therefore those who believe and do good works will have forgiveness and generous favors,
while those who strive to escape (the punishment mentioned in) Our verses, these are the people of Hell.
We have not sent a Messenger or a prophet before you who did not recite (what was revealed to him) without the Devil trying to intervene [to sow doubt in the hearts of the people about] his recitation. Allah abrogates what the Devil suggests, and Allah strengthens His verses. Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
To make a temptation to those who have a heart disease and those who are hard-hearted out of what the Devil casts... The unjust are certainly in a deep schism.
And so that those to whom knowledge has been given may know that (the Qur'an) is indeed the Truth from your Lord, let them then believe in it, and let their hearts submit to it in all humility. Verily, Allah guides those who believe to the right path.
And those who disbelieve will not cease to doubt him, until the Hour overtakes them unexpectedly or the punishment of a terrifying day overtakes them.
The sovereignty on that day will belong to Allah who will judge among them. Those who have believed and done good works will be in the Gardens of Delight,
and as for the infidels who have treated Our revelations as lies, they will have a degrading punishment!
Those who emigrate in the cause of Allah and are killed or die, Allah will indeed give them a great reward, for Allah is the best of givers.
Verily, He will bring them into a place that they are pleased with, and Allah is All-Knowing and Forgiving.
So it is. Whoever punishes in the same way that he was punished, and then he is the victim of a new insult, Allah will help him, for Allah is certainly the Absolutor and Forgiver.
This is how Allah brings night into day, and brings day into night. Verily, Allah is the Hearer and the Clairvoyant.
Thus Allah is the True, while what they invoke besides Him is false; Allah is the Exalted, the Great.
Have you not seen that Allah sends down water from heaven, and then the earth becomes green? Allah is Full of Kindness and Knower.
To Him belongs what is in heaven and on earth. Allah is the only One who is sufficient to Himself and is the One Worthy of praise.
Have you not seen that Allah has subdued to you all that is on the earth and the ship that sails on the sea by His command? He holds back the heavens from falling to the earth, except when He allows it. For Allah is full of kindness and mercy toward men.
It is He who gives you life, then gives you death, then makes you live again. Truly man is very ungrateful!
To each community We have assigned a worship to follow. Let them not dispute with you what they have received! And call to your Lord. You are certainly on a straight path.
And if they argue with you, then say, "Allah knows best what you are doing.
Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection what you disagree with."
Do you not know that Allah knows what is in heaven and on earth? All this is in a Book, and it is very easy for Allah.
And they worship besides Allah that in which He has sent down no evidence and of which they have no knowledge. And there will be no protector for the unrighteous.
And when Our clear verses are recited to them, you will discern the reprobation on the faces of those who have disbelieved. They are very far from throwing themselves at those who recite Our verses to them. Say: "Shall I inform you of something more terrible? - Fire: Allah has promised it to those who have disbelieved. And what a sad future!"
O men! A parable is proposed to you, listen to it: "Those whom you invoke apart from Allah would not even be able to create a fly, even if they were to unite for it. And if the fly robbed them of anything, they could not take it back from it. The solicitor and the solicited are [equally] weak!"
They did not value Allah at His true value; Verily, Allah is Mighty and Mighty.
Allah chooses messengers from among the angels and from among men. Allah is Hearing and Clairvoyant.
He knows what is in front of them and behind them. And it is to Allah that everything will return.
O you who believe! Bow down, bow down, worship your Lord, and do good. Maybe you will succeed!
And fight for Allah with all the effort He deserves. It is He who has chosen you; and He has not imposed any hindrance on you in the religion of your father Abraham, who has already called you "Muslims" before (this Book) and in this (Book), so that the Messenger may be a witness against you, and that you yourselves may be witnesses against the people. So perform Salah, pay Zakat, and hold fast to Allah. He is your Master. What an excellent master! And what a great support!
Blessed are the believers,
those who are humble in their salat,
who turn away from trivialities,
who pay Zakat,
and who preserve their sexes [from all intercourse],
except with their wives or the slaves they own, for there really they cannot be blamed;
whereas those who seek beyond these limits are transgressors;
and who see to the safeguarding of the deposits entrusted to them and honour their commitments,
and who strictly observe their Salah.
They are the heirs,
who will inherit Paradise to dwell there forever.
We have certainly created man from an extract of clay.
then We made a drop of semen out of it in a solid altar.
Then We made the sperm an adhesion; and adhesion We have created an embryo; and from this embryo We created bones and clothed the bones with flesh. Then We turned it into a completely different creation. Glory be to Allah, the Best of Creators!
And then, after that, you will die.
And then on the Day of Resurrection you will be resurrected.
We have created seven heavens above you. And We are not inattentive to creation.
And We have brought down the water from heaven in measure. Then We kept it in the earth, while We are quite capable of making it disappear.
With it We have produced for you gardens of palm trees and vines, in which you have abundant fruit and from which you eat,
as well as a tree (the olive tree) that grows on Mount Sinai, producing the oil used for anointing and where the eaters dip their bread.
You certainly have a subject for meditation in cattle. We give you to drink of what they have in their belly, and you will also find many uses in them; and you feed off it.
On them as well as on ships you are transported.
We sent Noah to his people. He said: "O my people, worship Allah. You have no other god besides Him. Are you not afraid of [him]?"
Then the leaders of his people who had disbelieved said: "This is only a human being like you, who wants to distinguish himself to your detriment. If Allah had willed, He would have sent down angels. We have never heard this from our most remote ancestors.
He is really only a man afflicted with madness, so watch him for a while.
He said, "Lord! Help me because they call me a liar."
We revealed to him: "Build the ark before Our eyes and according to Our revelation. And when Our commandment comes, and the oven is boiling, bring in a couple of every kind, and your family, except those of them against whom the word has already been spoken; and do not speak to Me about the unrighteous, for they will be fatally drowned.
And when you and those who are with you are seated in the ark, say: "Praise be to Allah who has saved us from the people of the unjust."
And say, "Lord, bring me ashore from a blessed landing. You are the One who brings the best landing."
These are indeed signs. We are certainly the One who experiences.
And after them We created other generations,
We sent a Messenger from among them to say to them: "Worship Allah. You have no other god besides Him. Are you not afraid of him?"
The leaders of his people who had disbelieved and dismissed the encounter with the Hereafter, and to whom We had granted luxury in this life, said: "This is only a human being like you, eating of what you eat, and drinking of what you drink.
If you obey a man like you, then you will lose.
Does he promise you, when you are dead, and turned to dust and bones, that you will have come out [of your graves]?
Far, far, what we promise you!
This is only our present life: we die and we live; and we will never be resurrected.
It is only a man who forges a lie against Allah; and we will not believe in him."
He said, "Lord! Help me because they call me a liar."
[Allah] says: "Yes, soon they will come to regret."
The cry, therefore, seizes them in all justice; then We made them like debris carried away by the torrent. May the unrighteous disappear forever!
Then after them We created other generations.
No community can advance or postpone its end.
Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Whenever a messenger came to his community, they called him a liar. And We made them succeed one another [in destruction], and We made them the themes of legendary tales. May the people who do not believe disappear forever!
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our wonders and clear proof,
to Pharaoh and his nobles, but they were puffed up with pride: they were haughty people.
They said, "Shall we believe in two men like us, whose fellows are our slaves?"
They called them [both] liars, and so they were among the destroyed.
And We brought the Book to Moses for guidance.
And We made a miracle of the son of Mary, as well as of his mother; and We gave refuge to both of them on a stable hill with a spring.
O Messengers! Eat of what is permissible and pleasant and do good. For I know perfectly well what you are doing.
This community, yours, is one community, while I am your Lord. Fear Me, then."
But they divided into sects, each sect exulting in what it held.
Leave them in their wandering for a while.
Do they think that what We grant them, in goods and children,
[i.e., an advance] that We hasten to make to them on the goods [of the future life]? On the contrary, they are not aware of it.
Those who, by the fear of their Lord, are penetrated,
who believe in the verses of their Lord,
who associate nothing with their Lord,
who give what they give, while their hearts are full of fear [at the thought] that they must return to their Lord.
These people rush to good deeds and are the first to perform them.
We impose on no one except according to his ability. And with Us there is a Book that speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged.
But their hearts remain in ignorance of this [the Qur'an]. [In addition] they have other (vile) deeds that they perform,
until by punishment We seize the wealthiest among them, and behold, they cry out for help.
"Don't shout today. No one will protect you from Us.
My verses were recited to you before; but you turned away from it,
puffing themselves up with pride, and you would denigrate them during your vigils."
Do they not meditate on the word (the Qur'an)? Or did they come to what never came to their first ancestors?
Or did they not know their Messenger to the point of denying him?
Or will they say, "He's crazy?" On the contrary, it is the truth that he has brought them. And most of them disdain the truth.
If the truth were in accordance with their passions, the heavens and the earth and those in them would certainly be corrupt. On the contrary, We have given them their reminder. But they turn away from it.
Or do you ask them for a reward? But the reward of your Lord is better. And He is the Best of Providers.
And you are calling them, indeed, to the right path.
However, those who do not believe in the hereafter are far removed from this path.
If We were to show them mercy and remove evil from them, they would certainly persist in their transgression, confused and hesitant.
We have indeed seized them with the punishment, but they have not submitted to their Lord; as they do not beseech [Him],
until the day when We open a door to harsh punishment for them, and behold, they will be in despair.
And it is He who has created for you hearing, eyes and hearts. But you're rarely grateful.
It is He who has spread you over the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.
And it is He who gives life and gives death; and the alternation of night and day depends on Him. Will you not then reason?
They rather said the same things as the elders.
They said, "When we are dead and are dust and bones, will we really be resurrected?
We were promised this, as well as our ancestors before; It's just old nonsense."
Say: "To whom belongs the earth and those who are on it? if you know."
They will say: "To Allah". Say: "Don't you remember?"
Say: "Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the sublime throne?"
They will say: "To Allah." Say: "Are you not afraid?"
Say: "Who holds in his hand the absolute kingship of all things, and who protects and does not need to be protected? [Say], if you know!"
They will say, "Allah." Say: "How is it that you are bewitched?" [to the point of not believing in Him].
Rather, we have brought them the truth and they are certainly liars.
Allah has not given Himself a child, and there is no god with Him; otherwise, each deity would go away with what he has created, and some would be superior to the others. (Glory and purity) to Allah! He is Superior to all that they describe.
[It is] Knower of all things visible and invisible! He is far above what they associate with Him!
Say, "Lord, if You ever show me what is promised to them;
so, Lord, do not place me among the unrighteous people.
We are able, indeed, to show you what We promise them.
Repels evil with what is better. We know very well what they are describing.
And say, "Lord, I seek Your protection, from the incitements of the devils.
and I seek Your protection, O Lord, from their presence with me."
... Then, when death comes to one of them, he says, "My Lord! Bring me back (to earth),
so that I may do good in what I was abandoning." No, it is simply a word that he says. Behind them, however, there is a barrier, until the day they are resurrected."
Then when the Trunk is blown, there will be no kinship between them that day, and they will not ask each other any questions.
Those whose scales are heavy will be the blessed;
and those whose scales are light will be those who have ruined their own souls and they will remain eternally in Hell.
The fire will burn their faces and their lips will be clenched.
"Were not my verses recited to you and you called them lies?"
They said, "Lord! Our misfortune overcame us, and we were misguided people.
Lord, bring us out of it! And if we reoffend, then we will be unjust."
He said, "Be repressed (humiliated) and speak no more to Me."
There was a group of My servants who said, "Lord, we believe; forgive us, therefore, and show us mercy, for You are the best of the Merciful."
but you took them in mockery to the point of forgetting to invoke Me, and you laughed at them.
Truly, I have rewarded them today for what they have endured; and they are the triumphant.
He'll say, "How many years have you been on earth?"
They'll say, "We stayed there a day, or part of a day. Ask those who matter."
He will say, "You have only stayed there for a short time, if you only knew.
Did you think that We had created you aimlessly, and that you would not be brought back to Us?"
May Allah, the true Ruler, be exalted. No god but Him, the Lord of the Sublime Throne!
And whoever invokes another god with Allah, without having clear proof [of his existence], will have to give an account of it to his Lord. Verily, the disbelievers will not succeed.
And say, "Lord, forgive and have mercy. You are the Best of the Merciful."
Here is a Surah which We have sent down and imposed, and We have sent down explicit verses in it so that you may remember."
The fornicator and the fornicator, whip them each with a hundred lashes. And do not have mercy on them in the execution of the law of Allah - if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And that a group of believers witness their punishment.
The fornicator will marry only a fornicator or an associate. And the fornicator shall not be married except by a fornicator or an associate; and this has been forbidden to believers.
And those who make accusations against chaste women without subsequently producing four witnesses, whip them with eighty lashes, and never again accept their testimony. And these are the perverts,
except for those who repent and reform themselves after that, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And as for those who make accusations against their own wives without having any witnesses other than themselves, the testimony of one of them must be a fourfold testimony by Allah that he is among the truthful.
and the fifth [testimony] is "may the curse of Allah fall upon him if he is of the liars."
And the punishment [of stoning] will not be inflicted on her if she testifies four times by Allah that he [her husband] is certainly among the liars.
and the fifth [testimony] is that the wrath of Allah be upon her, if he were of the truthful.
And were it not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy...! Allah is Great, Welcoming to repentance and Wise!
Those who came with the slander are a group of you. Don't think it's bad for you, but rather, it's good for you. To each of them what he has acquired as a sin. Whoever among them has taken on the greater part will have an enormous punishment.
Why, when you heard it, did not the believers in themselves conjecture favorably, and say, "This is an obvious calumny?"
Why didn't they call four witnesses? If they do not produce witnesses, then they are liars in the sight of Allah.
Had it not been for Allah's grace upon you and His mercy here and hereafter, a great punishment would have come upon you for this (slander) in which you have embarked,
when you spread the news with your tongues and said with your mouths what you had no knowledge of; and you counted it as insignificant, whereas in the eyes of Allah it is enormous.
And why, when you heard it, didn't you say, "We must not talk about it. Glory be to You (O Allah)! It's a huge slander"?
Allah exhorts you never to return to such a thing again if you are believers.
Allah clearly states the verses to you, and Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
Those who love the spread of turpitude among believers will have a painful punishment, both here and hereafter. Allah knows, and you do not know.
And if it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, and (had it not been) that Allah is Merciful and Merciful...
O you who have believed! Don't follow in the footsteps of the Devil. Whoever follows in the footsteps of the Devil, [know that] he commands turpitude and blameworthiness. And had it not been for Allah's grace to you and His mercy, none of you would ever have been pure. But Allah purifies whomever He wills. And Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
And let the holders of wealth and wealth among you not swear not to give any more to relatives, to the poor, and to those who emigrate in the cause of Allah. Let them forgive and absolve. Do you not like Allah to forgive you? and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful!
Those who make accusations against virtuous, chaste women [who do not even think of committing turpitude] and believers are cursed in this world as well as in the Hereafter; and they will have a great chastisement,
The day when their tongues, hands and feet will testify against them for what they were doing.
On that Day, Allah will give them their full and true reward; and they will know that Allah is the Truth.
The bad [women] to the bad [men], and the bad [men] to the bad [women]. In the same way, the good [women] to the good [men], and the good [men] to the good [women]. These are innocent of what others say. They have forgiveness and a generous reward.
O you who believe! Do not enter houses other than your own until you ask permission and greet their inhabitants. This is better for you. Maybe you remember.
If you do not find anyone there, then do not enter until permission is given to you. And if you say, "Go back," why, go back. This is purer for you. And Allah, of what you do, is All-Knowing.
There is no grievance against you for entering uninhabited houses where there is property for you. Allah knows what you divulge and what you hide.
Tell the believers to lower their eyes and keep their chastity. It's purer for them. Verily, Allah is Knower of what they do.
And tell the believing women to lower their eyes, to keep their chastity, and to show of their finery only what appears to be so, and to fold their veil over their breasts; and that they show their finery only to their husbands, or to their fathers, or to their husbands' fathers, or to their sons, or to their husbands' sons, or to their brothers, or to their brothers' sons, or to their sisters' sons, or to Muslim women, or to the slaves they own, or to the helpless male servants,  or to prepubescent boys who know nothing about the hidden parts of women. And let them not strike with their feet, so that it may be known what they hide from their adornments. And repent all of you to Allah, O believers, so that you may reap success.
Marry the bachelors among you and the good people among your slaves, men and women. If they are needy, Allah will make them rich by His grace. For Allah is immense and He is All-Knowing.
And let those who have no means of marrying seek to remain chaste until Allah makes them rich by His grace. Those of your slaves who seek a contract of emancipation, conclude this contract with them if you recognize any good in them; and give them the goods of Allah that He has bestowed upon you. And in your pursuit of the transient profits of this life, do not compel your slave wives into prostitution, if they wish to remain chaste. If they are forced to do so, Allah grants them His forgiveness and mercy after they have been compelled.
We have indeed sent down to you clear verses, giving a parable of those who lived before you, and an exhortation for the righteous!
Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. Its light is similar to a niche where there is a lamp. The lamp is in a crystal (container) and it resembles a star of great brilliance; Its fuel comes from a blessed tree: an olive tree that is neither Eastern nor Western whose oil seems to light up without the fire even touching it. Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whomever He wills. Allah offers men parables and Allah is All-Knowing.
In houses [mosques] that Allah has allowed to be raised, and where His Name is invoked; Glorify Him in them morning and afternoon,
men who are not distracted by trade or barter from the invocation of Allah, the performance of Salat and the payment of Zakat, and who fear a Day when hearts will be turned upside down as well as eyes.
So that Allah may reward them in the best way for what they have done. And He'll add His grace to them. Allah assigns to whom He wills without counting.
As for those who have disbelieved, their actions are like a mirage in a desert plain that the thirsty take for water. Then when he arrives, he realizes that it was nothing; but there Allah finds Him who settles his account in full, for Allah is quick to count.
[The deeds of the disbelievers] are also like darkness on a deep sea: waves cover it, [waves] above which rise [other] waves, on which there are [thick] clouds. Darkness [heaped up] one on top of the other. When someone stretches out his hand, he hardly distinguishes it. Whoever Allah deprives of light has no light.
Have you not seen that Allah is glorified by all who are in the heavens and the earth; as well as by the birds spreading their wings? Everyone, of course, has learned his way of worshipping and glorifying Him. Allah knows perfectly well what they are doing.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to Allah will be the final return.
Have you not seen that Allah pushes the clouds? Then He gathers them together and makes a heap of them, and you see the rain coming out of His womb. And He sends down from heaven hail [from] clouds [likened] to mountains. He strikes whomever He wills and removes it from whomever He wills. The brilliance of its lightning is very far from delighting the sight.
Allah alternates night and day. This is a matter for reflection for those who have eyes.
And Allah created every animal out of water. Some walk on their stomachs, others walk on two legs, and still others walk on four. Allah creates what He wills and Allah is Omnipotent.
We have certainly sent down explicit verses. And Allah guides whomever He wills to a straight path.
And they say, "We believe in Allah and the Messenger and we obey." Then after that, some of them do an about-face. These are not the believers.
And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge among them, behold, some of them depart.
But if they have the right in their favor, they come to him, submissive.
Is there a disease in their hearts? Or do they doubt? Or do they fear that Allah will oppress them and His Messenger? No!... but they are the unjust.
The only word of the believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge among them, is: "We have heard and we have obeyed." And these are the ones who succeed.
And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears Allah and fears Him... So, here are the ones who reap success.
And they swear by Allah in solemn oaths that if you commanded them, they would certainly go out (to battle). Say: "Do not swear. [Your] [verbal] obedience is well known. Allah is Knower of what you do."
Say: "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. If they turn away, ... he [the messenger] is then responsible only for what he is responsible for; and you assume what you are responsible for. And if you obey him, you will be well guided." And it is only incumbent on the messenger to convey explicitly (his message).
Allah has promised those of you who have believed and done good deeds that He will give them succession on earth as He gave it to those who came before them. He would give strength and supremacy to their religion, which He has approved for them. It would turn their old fear into security. They worship Me and do not associate anything with Me, and the one who disbelieves afterwards is the pervert.
Perform Salah, pay Zakat, and obey the Messenger, so that you may have mercy.
Do not think that those who do not believe can oppose the authority of Allah on earth. Fire will be their refuge. What a bad destination.
O you who have believed! Let the slaves you own ask your permission before entering, as well as those of your own who have not yet reached puberty, at three times: before the dawn salat, at noon when you take off your clothes, and after the night salat; three opportunities to undress. Apart from these moments, there is no reproach to you or them for coming and going, to each other's homes. This is how Allah clearly states His verses to you, and Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And when the children among you reach puberty, let them ask permission before they come in, as do their elders. This is how Allah clearly states His verses to you, and Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And as for the women who have gone through menopause and no longer hope for marriage, there is no reproach to them for taking off their clothes when they go out, but without showing their finery, and if they seek chastity, it is better for them. Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
There is no hindrance to the blind, the lame, the sick, or yourselves from eating in your own houses, or in the houses of your fathers, or in the houses of your mothers, or of your brothers, or of your sisters, or of your paternal uncles, or of your paternal aunts, or of your maternal uncles, or of your maternal aunts,  or in those of which you possess the keys, or in the houses of your friends. Nor is there any impediment to you from eating together, or separately. Therefore, when you enter houses, greet each other with greetings from Allah, blessed and pleasant. This is how Allah exposes His verses to you, so that you may understand.
The true believers are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and who, when they are in His company on matters of general interest, do not leave until they ask His permission. Those who ask you for this permission are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. If, therefore, they ask your permission for a personal matter, give it to whomever you want of them; and beg Allah's forgiveness for them, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Don't think of the messenger's call as a call to one another. Verily, Allah knows those of your people who go away secretly in secret. Let them, therefore, who oppose his command, take heed that a trial does not come upon them, or that a painful punishment befalls them.
To Allah, indeed, belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth. He knows perfectly well the state you are in, and on the Day when men are brought back to Him, He will then inform them of what they were doing. Allah is All-Knowing.
Let the Blessing of Him who sent down the Book of Discernment upon His servant be exalted, that he may be a warner to the universe.
He to whom belongs the kingdom of heaven and earth, who has not given Himself a child, who has no partner in His kingship, and who has created all things by giving them their rightful proportions.
But they have adopted besides Him gods who, being themselves created, create nothing, and who possess neither the faculty of doing evil nor good for themselves, and who are masters neither of death, nor of life, nor of the resurrection.
The disbelievers say: "All this is a lie that he (Muhammad) invented, and where other people helped him." However, they are committing an injustice and a lie.
And they say, "These are the tales of the elders that he has written! We dictate them to him morning and evening!"
Say: "He who knows secrets in heaven and earth has sent down him. And He is Forgiving and Merciful.
And they say, "What is this Messenger who eats food and goes about in the markets? Why was it not that an angel who would have been a warner in his company had been sent down to him?
Or why has a treasure been thrown at him? Or why does he not have a garden of his own, from which he could eat (the fruit)?" The unrighteous say, "You follow only a bewitched man."
See how they compare you to! They have lost their way. They will not be able to find any way.
Blessed be He who, if He wills, will grant you much better than this: Gardens under which the streams flow; and He will assign you castles.
But they have instead called the Hour a lie. We have, however, prepared a burning Flame for anyone who calls the Hour a lie.
When she sees them from afar, they will hear her fury and her fizzes.
And when they have been thrown into it, in a narrow recess, with their hands tied behind their necks, they will then wish for their complete destruction.
"Today, don't want destruction once, but want it several.
Say, "Is this better? or the eternal Paradise which has been promised to the righteous, as a reward and final destination?
They will have there all they desire, and an eternal home. This is a promise incumbent on your Lord.
And on the Day He gathers them and those whom they worshipped besides Allah, He will say, "Are you the ones who have led this My servants astray, or have they themselves lost the path?"
They will say, "Glory to You! It was not fitting for us to take protective patrons besides You, but You have filled them and their ancestors with enjoyment to the point that they have forgotten the Book of Remembrance [the Qur'an]. And they were lost people."
"They have denied you what you say. There will be no escape or (possible) help for you. And whoever of yours is unjust, We will make him taste a great punishment."
And We sent before you only messengers who ate food and went about the markets. And We have made some of you a trial for others – will you endure with constancy? - And your Lord remains a Clairvoyant.
And those who do not hope to meet Us say, "If only angels had been sent down upon us, or if we could see our Lord." Indeed, they have puffed themselves up with pride, and have exceeded the limits of arrogance.
The day they see the Angels, it will not be good news, on that day, for the unrighteous, they (the Angels) will say: "Dam totally forbidden"!
We have considered the work they have done, and We have reduced it to scattered dust.
The people of Paradise will be in a better abode and in the most beautiful place of rest on that day.
And on the day when the sky is split by clouds and angels are sent down,
on that day, true kingship belongs to the Most Merciful, and it will be a difficult day for the infidels.
The day when the unrighteous will bite both his hands and say: "[Alas for me!] If only I had walked the path with the Messenger...
Woe to me! Alas! If only I hadn't taken "so-and-so" as a friend...
For it led me astray from the remembrance [of the Qur'an] after it came to me." And the Devil deserts man (after having tempted him).
And the Messenger said, "Lord, my people have truly taken this Qur'an for a forsaken thing."
Thus We made every prophet an enemy among the criminals. But your Lord is sufficient for a guide and a support.
And those who do not believe say: "Why was the Qur'an not sent down on him at one time?" We have revealed it in this way to strengthen your heart. And We have recited it carefully.
They will not bring you any parables, unless We bring you the truth with the best interpretation.
Those who are dragged [together] on their faces to Hell, these will be in the worst situation and the most led astray from the straight path.
For We brought the Book to Moses and assigned his brother Aaron to be his assistant.
Then We said, "Go both to the people who have called Our proofs a lie." We then destroyed them completely.
And the people of Noah, when they had denied the messengers, We drowned them and made a sign of warning to the people. And We have prepared for the unrighteous a painful punishment.
And the 'Aad, the Thamud, the people of Ar-Rass and many generations in between!
To all, however, We had made parables and destroyed them all in a brutal way.
They passed through the city on which a rain of misfortune fell. Do they not see it? But they do not hope for a resurrection!
And when they see you, they only mock you: "Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a Messenger?
He came very close to leading us astray from our divinities, if it were not for our patient attachment to them!" However, they will know when they see the chastisement, which is the most misguided in its way.
Do you not see him who has made his passion his divinity? Is it up to you to be a guarantor for him?
Or do you think most of them hear or understand? They are in truth comparable only to cattle. Or rather, they are still more lost from the path.
Have you not seen how your Lord spreads the shadow? If He had willed, He would have made it immobile. Then We gave him the sun his clue,
then We take it [to bring it back] to Us with ease.
And it is He who made you a garment of night, rest of sleep, and of day a return to active life.
And it was He who sent forth the winds as a proclamation preceding His mercy. We sent down from heaven pure and purifying water,
to revive a dead land through it, and to give drink to the many cattle and men whom We have created.
We had divided it among them so that they might remember (Us). But most people refuse to do anything but be ungrateful.
Now, if We had wished, We would certainly have sent a warner to every city.
Do not obey the infidels; and with this (the Qur'an), fight against them vigorously.
And it is He who gives free rein to the two seas: one sweet, refreshing, the other salty, bitter. And He assigns between the two an intermediate zone and an impassable barrier.
And it is He who created a human species out of water, which He unites by the bonds of kinship and covenant. And your Lord remains Omnipotent.
But they worship apart from Allah, which does not benefit them or harm them. And the unfaithful will always be the ally of the enemies of his Lord!
Now We have sent you only as a herald and a warner.
Say: "I do not ask you for any reward (for myself). However, whoever wants to follow a path leading to his Lord [is free to spend in the way of Allah]."
And place your trust in the Living One who never dies. And by His praise, glorify Him. He is sufficient as a Perfect Knower of the sins of His servants.
It is He who, in six days, created the heavens, the earth and all that exists between them, and the Most Merciful established Himself "Istawa" afterwards on the Throne. Ask therefore who is well informed about Him.
And when they are told, "Prostrate yourselves before the Most Merciful," they say, "What is the Most Merciful? Are we going to bow down to what you command us?" - And this increases their repulsion.
Blessed be He who has placed constellations in heaven and has placed a luminary (the sun) and also an illuminating moon in them.
And it is He who has assigned an alternation of night and day for anyone who wants to reflect on it or show gratitude.
The servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk humbly on earth, who, when the ignorant speak to them, say: "Peace",
who spend the nights prostrate and standing before their Lord;
who say, "Lord, take away from us the punishment of Hell." - for his punishment is permanent.
What a bad lodging and place to stay!
Who, when they spend, are neither prodigal nor miserly, but stand in the middle ground.
Who do not invoke any other god with Allah and do not kill the life that Allah has made sacred, except with good reason; who do not commit fornication - for whoever does this will incur punishment
and the punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and there he will remain eternally covered with shame;
except the one who repents, believes, and does a good deed; Allah will change their evil deeds into good, and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful;
and whoever repents and does a good deed, it is to Allah that his return will end.
Those who do not give false witness; and who, when they pass by a frivolity, depart from it nobly;
who, when reminded of the verses of their Lord, do not become deaf or blind;
and who say, "Lord, give us joy in our wives and descendants of the eyes, and make us a guide to the pious."
Such will be rewarded with a high place [of Paradise] because of their endurance, and there they will be welcomed with salvation and peace.
to remain there forever. What a beautiful cottage and place to stay!
Say: "My Lord will not care for you without your prayer; but you have denied (the Prophet). Your [chastisement] will be inevitable and permanent.
T'â, Sîn, Mim.
Here are the verses of the Explicit Book.
You may be consumed with grief because they are not believers!
If We wished, We would send down upon them from heaven a prodigy before which their necks will bow.
No new reminder comes to them from the Most Merciful without them dodging it.
And they called a lie [everything that comes to them from the Lord]. They will soon hear of what they are mocking.
Have they not observed the earth, how many generous couples of all kinds We have caused to grow there?
This is a proof! And most of them don't believe.
And your Lord is truly He, the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
And when your Lord called Moses, "Go to the unrighteous people,
[unto the] people of Pharaoh," will they not fear (Allah)?
He said, "Lord, I am afraid that they will call me a liar;
lest my breast be constricted, and my tongue may not be embarrassed: summon Aaron, then.
They have a crime to reproach me with; so I fear that they will kill me."
But [Allah] said to him: "Never! Go both with Our wonders, We will remain with you and We will listen.
So both of you go to Pharaoh and say, "We are the messengers of the Lord of the universe,
that you may send the Children of Israel back with us."
"Have we not brought you up among us as a child," said Pharaoh? And have you not dwelt among us for years of your life?
Then you committed the misdeed you did, despite all gratitude."
"I did it," said Moses, "while I was still among the lost.
So I fled from you when I was afraid of you, and then my Lord gave me wisdom and appointed me to be one of His messengers.
Is this a blessing on your part [that you remind me] with reproach, when you have enslaved the Children of Israel?"
"And what is the Lord of the universe?" said Pharaoh.
"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them," says [Moses], "if only you could be convinced of it!"
[Pharaoh] said to those around him, "Do you not hear?
[Moses] continues, "... Your Lord, and the Lord of your oldest ancestors."
"Truly," says [Pharaoh], "your messenger who has been sent to you is a madman."
[Moses] added, "... The Lord of the East and the Sunset, and of that which is between the two; if only you understood!"
"If you adopt," says [Pharaoh], "a deity other than me, I will put you among the prisoners."
"And even if I were to bring you," said [Moses], "a clear thing?
"Bring it," says [Pharaoh], "if you are of the truthful."
So [Moses] threw down his staff and he became a manifest serpent.
And he drew out his hand and behold, it was white (sparkling) to those who were looking.
[Pharaoh] said to the notables around him, "Here is indeed a learned magician.
He wants to expel you from your land by his magic. What do you order?"
They said, "Put them off and his brother, and send men into the cities to gather together,
and bring you every great learned magician."
The magicians were therefore assembled in appointment on the appointed day.
And it was said to the people, "Are you going to get together,
so that we may follow the magicians, if they are the overcomers?"
Then when the magicians arrived, they said to Pharaoh, "Will there really be a reward for us if we are the overcomers?"
He said, "Yes, of course, then you will be among my relatives."
Moses said to them, "Throw away what you have to throw away."
So they threw down their ropes and sticks and said, "By the power of Pharaoh... We will be the winners."
Then Moses threw down his staff, and behold, he grabbed what they had made.
Then the magicians fell prostrate,
saying, "We believe in the Lord of the universe,
The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
[Pharaoh] said, "Did you believe in him before I allowed you? In truth, he is your leader, who taught you magic! Well, you'll know soon! I will surely cut off your hands and legs opposite, and crucify you all."
They say, "There is no harm! For it is to our Lord that we will return.
We want our Lord to forgive us our sins for being the first to believe."
And We revealed to Moses, "Go by night with My servants, for you will be pursued."
Then Pharaoh sent gatherers [to say] in the cities:
"They are, in fact, a small gang,
but they irritate us,
while we are all vigilant."
So We brought them out of the gardens, out of the springs,
treasures and a pleasant place to stay.
It was so! And We gave them as an inheritance to the children of Israel.
At sunrise they pursued them.
Then, when the two parties saw each other, Moses' companions said, "We are going to be overtaken."
He says, "Never, for I have my Lord with me who will guide me."
Then We revealed to Moses, "Strike the sea with your staff." Then it split, and each side was like a huge mountain.
We brought the others [Pharaoh and his people] near.
And We saved Moses and all those who were with him;
then We drowned the others.
This is a prodigy, but most of them do not believe.
And your Lord is truly He, the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
And recite to them the news of Abraham:
When he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?"
They said, "We worship idols and we cling to them."
He said, "Do they hear you when you call [them]?
Or do they benefit you? or do they harm you?"
They said, "No! but we found our ancestors doing so."
He said, "What do you say about what you worshiped...?
You and your old ancestors?
They are all enemies to me except the Lord of the universe,
who created me, and it is He who guides me;
and it is He who feeds me and gives me drink;
and when I am sick, it is He who heals me,
and who will kill me, and then give me life again,
and it is from Him that I covet the forgiveness of my sins on the Day of Retribution.
Lord, grant me wisdom (and knowledge) and make me join the good;
grant that I may have an honorable mention on the tongues of posterity;
and make me one of the heirs of the Garden of Earthly Delights.
and forgive my father: for he was of the erring;
and do not cover me with shame on the day when they are resurrected,
the day when neither property nor children will be of any use,
except the one who comes to Allah with a sound heart."
Paradise for the pious will then be brought nearer,
and the Furnace will be exposed to wanderers,
and they will say to them, "Where are those whom you worshiped?
apart from Allah? do they help you? Or do they help themselves?"
So they will be thrown pell-mell, and so will the wanderers,
as well as all the legions of Iblis.
They will say, while quarrelling:
"By Allah! We were certainly in an obvious error,
when we made you the equals of the Lord of the universe.
It is only the criminals who have led us astray.
And we have no intercessors,
nor a warm friend.
If we could go back, then we would be among the believers!"
This is a sign; however, most of them do not believe.
And your Lord is truly the Mighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of Noah called the Messengers liars,
when Noah, their brother, (contributes) says to them: "Will you not fear [Allah]?
I am a trustworthy messenger to you.
Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me.
And I don't ask you for a salary for that; my salary belongs only to the Lord of the universe.
Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me."
They said, "Shall we believe in you, while the vilest follow you?
He said, "I don't know what those were doing.
Their account belongs only to my Lord. If only you are aware.
I am not the one who rejects believers.
I am only an explicit warning."
They said, "If you do not cease, Noah, you will certainly be among the stoned."
He said, "O my Lord, my people call me a liar.
So make a clear distinction between them and me; and save me and those of the believers who are with me."
So we saved him, as well as those who were with him in the ark, which was fully loaded.
And then we drowned the rest (the infidels).
This is a sign. However, most of them don't believe.
And Your Lord is truly the Mighty, the Most Merciful.
The 'Aad called the Messengers liars.
And when Hud, their brother, said to them, "Will you not fear [Allah]?"
I am a trustworthy messenger to you,
Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me.
And I don't ask you for a salary for that; my salary belongs only to the Lord of the universe.
Do you build a monument on every hill out of frivolity?
And do you build castles as if you were to remain forever?
And when you crack down on someone, you do it mercilessly.
Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me.
Fear Him who has provided you with [all the good things] that you know,
who provided you with cattle and children,
gardens and springs.
I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day."
They said, "Whether you exhort us or not, we don't care!
These are only the words of the ancients:
We will not be punished in any way."
So they called him a liar. And we put them to death. This is a sign! However, most of them don't believe.
And Your Lord is truly the Mighty, the Most Merciful.
The Thamud called the Messengers liars.
When Salih, their brother (contributes) said to them: "Will you not fear [Allah]?"
I am a trustworthy messenger to you.
Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me.
I do not ask you for a salary for this, my salary belongs only to the Lord of the universe.
Will you be left safe in your present condition?
In the middle of gardens, springs,
of crops and palm trees with digestible fruits?
Do you skillfully dig houses in the mountains?
Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me.
Do not obey the order of the outrageous,
which sow disorder on the earth and improve nothing".
They said, "You are only a bewitched man.
You are just a man like us. Bring a wonder, then, if you are of the truthful."
He said, "Here is a she-camel: it is for it to drink on an appointed day, and for you to drink on a day.
And do not inflict any harm on him, or the punishment of a terrible day will come upon you."
But they killed her. Well, they had reason to regret!
Punishment, in fact, seizes them. This is a prodigy. However, most of them don't believe.
And your Lord is truly He, the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of Lot called the Messengers liars,
when their brother Lot said to them, "Will you not fear [Allah]?
I am a trustworthy messenger to you.
Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me.
I do not ask you for a salary for this; my salary belongs only to the Lord of the universe.
Do you perform the carnal act with the males of this world?
And do you forsake the wives that your Lord has created for you? But you are just transgressors."
They said, "If you do not stop, Lot, you will certainly be among the expelled."
He says, "I really hate what you do.
Lord, save me and my family from what they are doing."
We then saved him and all his family,
except for an old woman who was among the exterminated.
Then We destroyed the others;
and We rained down on them (of stones). And what a fatal rain for those who are warned!
This is a prodigy. However, most of them don't believe.
And your Lord is truly He, the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
The people of Al-Ayka called the Messengers liars.
When Chuayb said to them: "Will you not fear [Allah]?"
I am a trustworthy messenger to you.
Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me,
and I do not ask you for a salary for it; my salary belongs only to the Lord of the universe.
Give it your full measure and don't let [people] lose any of it.
and weigh with an exact scale.
Don't give people less than they are due; and do not commit disorder and corruption on earth.
And fear Him who created you and the older generations."
They said, "You are indeed of the bewitched;
You are only a man like us; and truly we think that you are among the liars.
Drop pieces of heaven on us, if you are of the truthful."
He said, "My Lord knows best what you are doing."
But they called him a liar. Then the punishment of the Day of Darkness seized them. It was the punishment of a terrible day.
This is a prodigy. However, most of them don't believe.
And your Lord is truly He, the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
This (Qur'an) is the Lord of the universe who sent it down,
and the faithful Spirit came down with it
on your heart, that you may be of the warners,
in a very clear Arabic language.
And this was already mentioned in the writings of the elders.
Is it not a sign for them that the scholars of the Children of Israel know this?
If We had sent him down on any of the non-Arabs,
and if he had recited it to them, they would not have believed it.
Thus We have made [doubt] penetrate into the hearts of criminals;
but they will not believe it until they see the painful punishment,
who will come upon them suddenly, without them realizing it;
then they will say, "Are we going to be given a break?"
Do they seek to hasten Our chastisement?
Do you see if We allowed them to enjoy for years,
and then what happened to them was threatened,
the pleasures they have been allowed would be of no use to them.
And We do not destroy a city until it has had warners,
[as a reminder], and We are not unjust.
And it was not the devils who came down with this (the Qur'an):
it does not suit them; and they could not have done it.
For they are kept away from all listening (to the divine message).
Do not call upon another god with Allah, or you will be among the punished.
And warn the people who are closest to you.
And lower your wing [be kind] to the believers who follow you.
But if they disobey you, say to them, "I disavow what you are doing."
And place your trust in the Almighty, the Most Merciful,
who sees you when you get up,
and (see) thy gestures among those who bow down.
It is He truly, the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
Shall I teach you on whom the devils descend?
They descend on every slanderer, sinner.
They listen... However, most of them are liars.
And as for the poets, it is the lost who follow them.
Do you not see that they wander in every valley,
and that they say what they do not do?
except those who believe and do good deeds, who often invoke the name of Allah and defend themselves against the wrongs done to them. The unrighteous will soon see the turnaround they will experience!
T'â, Sîn. These are the verses of the Qur'an and an explicit Book,
a guide and good news to the believers,
who perform Salah, pay Zakat, and believe with certainty in the Hereafter.
As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We beautify their deeds, and then they become confused and hesitant.
They are the ones who will suffer the worst punishment, while they will be the biggest losers in the hereafter.
Verily, it is you who receive the Qur'an from a Sage, a Scholar.
(Recall) when Moses said to his family, "I saw a fire; I will bring you news of it, or I will bring you a lighted brand so that you may warm yourselves."
When he arrived there, he was called, "Blessed be He who is in the fire and He who is all around, and glory to Allah, the Lord of the universe."
"O Moses, it is I, Allah the Almighty, the Wise."
And: "Throw away your stick." When he saw him move like a snake, he turned his back [to flee] without retracing his steps. "Do not be afraid, Moses. The Messengers are not afraid of Me.
Except the one who committed an injustice and then replaced evil with good... then I am Forgiving and Merciful."
And thrust thy hand into the opening of thy tunic. She will come out white and without any harm - one of the nine wonders to Pharaoh and his people, for they are truly perverse people."
And when Our wonders came to them, clear and explicit, they said, "This is obvious magic!"
They denied them unjustly and proudly, while in themselves they believed them with certainty. Look at what has become of the corrupters.
We have indeed given David and Solomon a knowledge; and they said, "Praise be to Allah, who has favored us over many of His believing servants."
And Solomon inherited from David and said, "O men! We have been taught the language of birds; and we have been given a share of all things. This is truly the evident grace.
And his armies of jinn, men, and birds were gathered together for Solomon, and were placed in ranks.
When they arrived at the Valley of the Ants, an ant said, "O ants, enter into your dwellings, lest Solomon and his armies crush you [under their feet] without realizing it."
He smiled, amused by his words and said: "Allow me, Lord, to give thanks for the benefit with which You have bestowed upon me and my father and mother, and that I may do a good work which You may accept and bring me, by Your mercy, into Your virtuous servants."
Then he went over the birds and said, "Why don't I see the hoopoe? Is she among the absentees?
I will punish her severely! or I will slaughter him! or it will bring me an explicit argument."
But she had only been absent for a short time, and said, "I have learned what you have not learned; and I bring you reliable news from Saba:
I found that a woman is their queen, that she has been fulfilled with everything and that she has a magnificent throne.
I found her and her people bowing down to the sun instead of Allah. The Devil has made their deeds more beautiful, and has led them astray, and they are not well guided.
Why do they not bow down to Allah, who brings out what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and who knows what you hide and what you divulge?
Allah! There is no god but Him, the Lord of the Immense Throne.
Then Solomon said, "We will see if you told the truth or if you lied.
Go with my letter, which is this; then throw it at them; Then stand away from them to see what their response will be.
The queen said, "O notables! A noble letter has been thrown to me.
It comes from Solomon; and it is: "In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful,
Do not be haughty with me and come to me in all submission."
She said, "O notables! Advise me on this matter: I will not decide anything unless you are present (to advise me)."
They said, "We are possessors of tremendous strength and power. The command, however, belongs to you. Look at what you want to order."
She said: "Truly, when kings enter a city they corrupt it, and make its honorable citizens humiliated. And that's how they act.
I will send them a present, and then I will see what the envoys bring back."
Then when [the delegation] came to Solomon, he said, "Are you willing to help me with goods? whereas what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. But it's you who is more interested in your gift.
Go back to them. We will come with armies against which they will have no resistance, and we will expel them from them all humiliated and despised.
He said: "O notables! Which of you will bring me his throne before they come to me in subjection?"
A fearsome jinn said, "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place, for that I am strong and trustworthy."
Someone who had knowledge of the Book said, "I'll bring it to you before you blink." When Solomon then saw the throne set up beside him, he said, "This is the grace of my Lord, to try me whether I am thankful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful it is in his own interest that he does it, and whoever is ungrateful... then my Lord is sufficient to Himself and He is generous."
And he said, "Make her throne unrecognizable, and then we will see whether she will be guided or whether she is of the unguided."
When she had come, they said to her, "Is your throne like this?" She says, "It's like he is." - [Solomon said]: "Knowledge was given to us before her; and we were already submissive."
However, what she worshipped apart from Allah prevented her from being a believer, because she was a member of a disbelieving people.
He was told, "Enter the palace." Then, when she saw it, she mistook it for deep water and uncovered her legs. Then [Solomon] said to him, "This is a palace paved with crystal." She said: "Lord, I have wronged myself: I submit with Solomon to Allah, Lord of the universe."
We did indeed send their brother Salih to the Thamûd. [who says to them]: "Worship Allah." And now they divided into two groups that quarrelled.
He said, "O my people, why do you seek to hasten evil rather than good? If only you would ask Allah for forgiveness? Perhaps you would have mercy.
They said, "We see in you and in those who are with you bearers of misfortune." He said: "Your fate depends on Allah. But you are rather people who are subjected to temptation.
And there was a group of nine people in the city who were making a mess of the earth and doing nothing good.
They said, "Let us swear by Allah that we will attack him and his family by night. Then we will say to the one who is in charge of avenging him: "We did not witness the murder of his family, and we are sincere."
They hatched a ruse, and We hatched a ruse without their realizing it.
Look, then, at what was the consequence of their stratagem: We put them and all their people to death.
So their houses are deserted because of their misdeeds. This is a warning to people who know.
And We saved those who had believed and were righteous.
[And remind them] Lot, when he said to his people: "Do you give yourself over to turpitude [homosexuality] when you see clearly?"
Do you go to men instead of women to satisfy your desires? You are rather an ignorant people.
Then his people had only this answer: "Expel the family of Lot from your city! For these are people who affect purity.
We saved him and his family, except his wife, for whom We had determined that she should be among the exterminated.
And We rained down on them (of stones). And what a bad rain it is for the people who have been warned!
Say: "Praise be to Allah and peace be upon His servants whom He has chosen." Which is better: Allah or what they associate with Him?
Is it not He who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from heaven with which We have made beautiful gardens grow? You were not able to make their trees grow at all. Is there a god with Allah? No, but they are people who give Him equals.
Is it not He who has established the earth as a place to dwell, placed rivers through it, assigned firm mountains to it, and established a separation between the two seas, - Is there then a god with Allah? No, but most of them don't know.
Is it not He who answers the anguished when he calls upon Him, and who takes away evil, and makes you succeed on earth, generation after generation, - Is there then a god with Allah? It's rare that you remember!
Is it not He who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and sends forth the winds, as a good announcement preceding His grace? - Is there a god with Allah? Allah is exalted above what they associate with Him.
Is it not He who begins creation, then remakes it, and who nourishes you with heaven and earth? Is there a god with Allah? Say: "Bring your proof, if you are truthful."
Say: "None of those who are in the heavens and on the earth knows the Unknowable except Allah." And they do not know when they will be resurrected!
But their sciences have converged on the subject of the other world. They are rather doubtful about it. Or rather, they are blind to it.
And those who do not believe say, "When we and our fathers are dust, will we really be brought up (from our graves)?
Certainly, we and our fathers were promised this before. These are only old tales!"
Say: "Go through the earth and see what has become of the criminals."
And do not grieve over them or be distressed because of their plot.
And they say, "When will this promise be made, if you're truthful?"
Say: "It may be that some of what you are trying to hasten is already on your heels."
True, your Lord is a provider of grace to men, but most of them are not grateful.
Verily, your Lord knows what is hidden in their breasts and what they are disclosing.
And there is nothing hidden in heaven and earth that is not in an explicit Book.
This Qur'an tells the Children of Israel about most of the subjects on which they differ,
while he is a guide and a mercy for believers.
Your Lord will certainly decide between them by His judgment; and He is the Almighty, the Wise.
So put your trust in Allah, for you are obviously in the truth and righteousness.
You cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they flee with their backs turned.
Nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You shall only make those who believe in Our verses and submit to hear.
And when the Word falls upon them, We will bring out of the ground a beast that will speak to them; the people were by no means convinced of the truth of Our signs [or verses].
And on the Day when We gather from every community a crowd of those who denied Our revelations, and they will be placed in ranks.
and when they have arrived, [Allah] will say: "Have you treated My signs as lies without having embraced them with your knowledge? Or what were you doing?"
And the Word will fall upon them because of their misdeeds. And they won't be able to say anything.
Have they not seen that in truth We have appointed the night for them to rest, and the day to see? This is much evidence for people who believe.
And on the Day when the trumpet is blown, all those who are in the heavens and those who are in the earth will be afraid, except those whom Allah has willed [to preserve]! - And all will come to Him humbling themselves.
And you will see the mountains - you think they are frozen - as they pass like clouds. This is the work of Allah who has fashioned everything to perfection. He is a Perfectly Knowledgeable of what you do!
Whoever comes with good will have much better, and on that day they will be safe from all fear.
And whoever will come with evil... then they will be knocked down with their faces in the Fire. Aren't you only paid according to what you worked?"
"I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Mecca) whom He has sanctified, and to Him all things, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims,
and to recite the Qur'an." Whoever guides himself, it is for himself that he guides himself. And whoever goes astray, then say, "I'm just one of the warners."
Say: "Praise be to Allah! He will show you His proofs, and you will know them." Your Lord is not inattentive to what you do.
T'â, Sîn, Mîm.
Here are the verses of the Explicit Book.
We tell you in all truth, the story of Moses and Pharaoh, for the benefit of people who believe.
Pharaoh was haughty on earth; He divided his inhabitants into clans, in order to take advantage of the weakness of one of them: he slaughtered their sons and left their wives alive. He was really among the troublemakers.
But We wanted to favor those who had been weak on earth and make them rulers and heirs,
and to establish them mightily on earth, and to show Pharaoh, Haman, and their soldiers, what they feared.
And We revealed to Moses' mother, "Suckle him. And when you fear for him, throw him into the flood. And do not be afraid or grieved: We will give him back to you and make him a Messenger."
Pharaoh's men took him in, so that he would be an enemy to them and a source of affliction. Pharaoh, Haman and their soldiers were at fault.
And Pharaoh's wife said, "(This child) will gladden my eye and yours! Don't kill him. He could be useful to us or will we take him as a child." And they had no sense of it.
And the heart of Moses' mother became empty. She came very near divulging everything, if We had not strengthened her heart so that she would remain among the believers.
She said to her sister, "Follow him," and she saw him from afar without them noticing.
We had previously forbidden her (the breast) of wet nurses. So she (Moses' sister) said, "Would you like me to show you the people in a house who will do it for you and be kind to her?" ...
So We gave him back to his mother, so that her eye would rejoice, and she would not grieve, and she might know that Allah's promise is true. But most of them don't know.
And when he had reached maturity and full formation, We gave him the faculty of judgment and a science. This is how We reward the beneficent.
He entered the city at a time of inattention on the part of its inhabitants; there he found two men fighting, one of his partisans and the other of his adversaries. The man of his party called him for help against his enemy. Moses punched him and finished him off. - [Moses] said, "This is the work of the Devil. He is really an enemy, an obvious misguide."
He said, "Lord, I have wronged myself; forgive me." And He forgave him. He is truly the Forgiving, the Merciful!
He said, "Lord, because of the blessings you have bestowed upon me, I will never support criminals."
The next morning he was in town, fearful and looking about him, when the man who had asked him for help the day before called to him with loud cries. Moses said to him, "You are indeed an open provocateur."
When he wanted to strike a blow at their common enemy, he (the Israelite) said, "O Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant on earth; and you do not want to be among the benefactors."
And then a man came running from the end of the city and said, "O Moses, the notables are convening about you to kill you. Leave (the city). That's the advice I give you."
He came out of there, fearful, looking about him. He said, "Lord, save me from [this] unrighteous people!"
And when he went to Madyan, he said, "I wish my Lord to guide me to the right path."
And when he came to the watering hole of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their animals] and he also found two women standing apart and holding [their animals]. He said, "What do you want?" They said, "We will not water until the shepherds are gone; and our father is very old."
He watered [the animals] for them and then went back to the shade and said, "Lord, I have great need of the good that you will bring down to me."
Then one of the two women came to him with a timid gait and said, "My father is calling you to reward you for watering for us." And when he came to him and told him his story, he (the old man) said, "Do not be afraid, for you have escaped from the unrighteous."
One of them said, "O my father, hire him [to your service] for a fee, for the best to hire is the one who is strong and trustworthy."
He said, "I would like to marry you to one of my two daughters, on condition that you work for me for eight years. If you finish ten [years], it will be of your own free will; I do not wish, however, to impose anything excessive on you. You will find me, Allah willing, among the good."
"It is (concluded) between you and me," said [Moses]. Whichever of the two terms I assign to myself, there will be no pressure on me. And Allah is the Guarantor of what we say."
Then, when Moses had completed the appointed period and set out with his family, he saw a fire on the side of the Mount. He said to his family, "Stay here. I saw fire. Perhaps I will bring you a new one or a firebrand so that you can warm yourselves."
Then when he arrived there, he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree: "O Moses! It is I, Allah, the Lord of the universe."
And: "Throw away your staff" Then when he saw it move as if it were a snake, he turned his back without even turning around. "O Moses! Approach and do not be afraid: you are among those who are safe.
Put your hand in the opening of your tunic, and it will come out white without any harm. And hold your arm close to you so that you are not afraid. These, then, are two proofs of your Lord for Pharaoh and his notables. They are really perverse people."
"Lord," said [Moses], "I have killed one of them, and I am afraid they will kill me.
But Aaron, my brother, is more eloquent than I. Send him therefore with me as an helper, to declare my truthfulness: I am truly afraid that they will call me a liar."
[Allah] said: "We will, through your brother, strengthen your arm, and give you irrefutable arguments; they will not be able to reach you, thanks to Our signs [Our miracles]. The two of you and those who follow you will be the winners.
Then when Moses came to them with Our evident wonders, they said, "This is just invented magic. We have never heard of this from our first ancestors."
And Moses said, "My Lord knows best who came from Him with the guidance, and to whom the final Abode shall belong. Truly, the unrighteous will not succeed."
And Pharaoh said, "O notables, I know no god for you but me. Haman, light fire for me on clay and then build me a tower, and then perhaps I will ascend to the God of Moses. I rather think that he is one of the liars."
And he was puffed up with pride on earth as well as his soldiers, without any right. And they thought that they would not be brought back to Us.
So we seized him and his soldiers, and threw them into the flood. Look what has become of the unjust!
We made them leaders who called the people to the Fire. And on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped.
We followed them, in this life here below, with a curse. And on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the despised.
We have indeed given the Book to Moses, after having destroyed the older generations, as an enlightening evidence for the people, as well as guidance and mercy so that they may remember.
You were not on the western slope (of Sinai) when We decreed the commandments to Moses; you were not among the witnesses.
But We have given birth to generations whose age has been prolonged. And you were not [either] a resident among the people of Madyan reciting Our verses to them; but We send the Messengers.
And you were not on the side of Mount Tor when We called. But (thou hast come as) a mercy of thy Lord, to warn a people to whom no warner before thee hath come, that they may remember.
If a calamity were to befall them in retribution for what their own hands had prepared, they would say, "Lord, why did You not send us a Messenger? Then we would have followed Your verses and we would have been believers."
But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, "If only he had received the same thing as Moses." Did they not deny what had previously been brought to Moses? They said, "Two magics have mutually supported each other!" And they said, "We have no faith in any."
Say to them: "Bring a Book from Allah that is a better guide than these two, and I will follow it if you are truthful."
But if they don't answer you, then know that it's only their passions that they're following. And who is more misguided than the one who follows his passion without guidance from Allah? Allah, truly, does not guide unjust people.
We have already expounded the Word (the Qur'an) to them so that they may remember.
Those to whom We brought the Book before it [the Qur'an] believe in it.
And when it is recited to them, they say, "We believe in it. This is indeed the truth emanating from our Lord. Even before his arrival, we were Submissive."
These are the ones who will receive twice their reward for their endurance, for responding to evil with good, and for spending of what We have allotted to them;
and when they hear trivialities, they turn away from them and say, "Ours are our deeds, and yours are yours. Peace be upon you. We are not looking for the ignorant."
You [Muhammad] do not rule over the one you love, but Allah guides whom He wills. However, he knows the rightly guided better.
And they said, "If we follow the right path with you, we will be torn from our land." - Have We not established them in a sacred, safe precinct, to which products of all kinds are brought as an allottance from Us? But most of them don't know.
And how many cities have We destroyed that were ungrateful (while their inhabitants lived in abundance), and behold, after them their dwellings are but very little inhabited, and it was We who were the heirs of them.
Your Lord does not destroy cities until you have sent a Messenger to their metropolis to recite Our verses to them. And We do not destroy cities except when their inhabitants are unjust.
All that has been given to you is the ephemeral enjoyment of life in this world and its adornment, while what is with Allah is better and more enduring... Don't you understand?
Is He to whom We have made a beautiful promise, which he will see fulfilled, comparable to the one to whom We have granted the enjoyment of this present life, and which will be the Day of Resurrection, of those who will appear (before Us).
And the day He calls them, He'll say, "Where are those that you claimed to be My associates?"
Those against whom the Word is fulfilled will say, "Behold, Lord, those whom we have deceived. We have seduced them as we have led ourselves astray. We disown them before You: it is not us that they worshipped."
And they will be told, "Call your associates." They will call them, but they will not answer them. When they see the chastisement, then they will wish to have followed the right path (in this life).
And the day that He calls them and says, "What did you say to the Messengers?"
On that day, their arguments will become obscure and they will not ask themselves any questions.
But the one who has repented, who has believed and done good, may be among those who succeed.
Your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; it has never been up to them to choose. Glory be to Allah! He transcends what they associate with Him!
Your Lord knows what is hidden in their breasts and what they are disclosing.
He is Allah. No god but Him. To Him be praise here on earth as well as in the Hereafter. To Him belongs the judgment. And to Him you will be brought back.
Say: "What would you say? If Allah were to assign you the night permanently until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than Allah could bring you light? Do you not hear?"
Say: "What would you say? If Allah were to assign you the day permanently until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than Allah could bring you a night on which you would rest? Do you not observe?"
It is by His mercy that He has assigned you night and day: that you may rest and seek His grace, and that you may be thankful.
And the day He calls them, He'll say, "Where are those that you claimed to be My associates?"
However, We will bring out a witness from each community, and then We will say, "Bring your decisive evidence." Then they will know that the Truth is Allah's; and that what they had invented abandoned them.
Truly, Korah was of the people of Moses, but he was full of violence towards them. We had given him treasures, the keys of which weighed heavily on a whole band of strong people. His people said to him, "Do not rejoice. For Allah does not like the arrogant.
And seek through what Allah has given you, the Last Abode. And don't forget your part in this life. And be kind as Allah has been kind to you. And don't look for corruption on earth. For Allah does not love corrupters."
He says, "It is by a knowledge that I possess that this came to me." Did he not know that before him Allah had destroyed generations greater than him in strength and richer in possessions? And criminals will not be questioned about their sins!"
He went out to his people in all his pomp. Those who loved the present life said, "If only we had like what was given to Korah. He was certainly endowed with an immense fortune."
And those to whom knowledge was given said, "Woe to you! Allah's reward is better for him who believes and does good." But it will only be received by those who endure.
So we caused the earth to swallow him and his house. No clan besides Allah was there to help him, and he could not help himself.
And those who, the day before, wished to be in his place, began to say: "Ah! It is true that Allah increases the share of whomever He wills among His servants or restricts it. If Allah had not favored us, He would certainly have caused us to be swallowed up. Ah! It is true that those who do not believe do not succeed."
This Last Abode We reserve for those who seek neither to ascend on earth nor to sow corruption on it. However, the happy end belongs to the pious.
Whoever comes with good will have better than this; and whoever comes with evil, (let him know that) those who commit misdeeds will not be rewarded except according to what they have committed.
The One who prescribed the Qur'an for you will certainly bring you back to where you (wish) to return. Say: "My Lord knows best the one who has given guidance and the one who is in obvious error.
You did not expect that the Book would be revealed to you. This was only by the mercy of your Lord. Therefore never be a support to the infidels;
and let them not turn you away from the verses of Allah once they have been sent down to you. Call the people to your Lord and do not be among the Associates.
And do not invoke any other deity with Allah. There is no divinity but Him. Everything must perish except His Face. To Him belongs the judgment; and to Him you will be brought back.
Alif, Lâm, Mîm.
Do people think that they will be allowed to say, "We believe!" without testing them?
Verily, We have tried those who lived before them; [Thus] Allah knows those who speak the truth and those who lie.
Or do those who commit misdeeds expect to be able to escape from Us? How bad their judgment is!
Whoever hopes to meet Allah, the time set by Allah will certainly come. And He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
And whoever fights, fights only for himself, for Allah can do without the whole universe.
And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We will blot out their misdeeds, and We will reward them with the best reward for what they have done.
And We have enjoined man to treat his father and mother well, and "if they force you to associate with Me, of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them." To Me is your return, and then I will inform you of what you were doing.
And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We will certainly bring them among the righteous.
Among the people there are those who say, "We believe in Allah," and then, if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah, they regard the trial of men as a punishment from Allah. But if it comes from the help of your Lord, they will certainly say, "We were with you." Is not Allah the best to know what is in everyone's chests?
Allah knows the believers perfectly and knows the hypocrites perfectly.
And those who do not believe say to those who believe; "Follow our path, and let us bear with your trespasses." But they will not bear any of their faults. In truth, they are liars.
And most certainly, they will carry their burdens and other burdens in addition to their own burdens. and they will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about what they were inventing.
And indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He dwelt among them a thousand years minus fifty years. Then the flood swept them away when they were unjust.
Then We saved him and the people of the ark; and We made it a warning to the universe.
And Abraham, when he said to his people; "Worship Allah and fear Him: it is much better for you if you knew."
You worship only idols, besides Allah, and you forge a lie. Those whom you worship besides Allah have no means of providing you with food; seek your sustenance with Allah. Worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you will be brought back.
And if you cry lies, other nations before you have also called (their prophets) liars. The Messenger, however, is responsible only for the clear transmission.
Do they not see how Allah begins creation and then remakes it? This is easy for Allah.
Say, "Go through the earth and see how He began creation. Then how Allah creates the ultimate generation. For Allah is Omnipotent."
He chastises whom He wills and shows mercy to whom He wills; and to Him you will be brought back.
And you will not be able to oppose His power either on earth or in heaven; and there is no ally or helper for you besides Allah.
And those who do not believe in the verses of Allah and in meeting Him, despair of My mercy. And these will have a painful punishment.
His people made no other answer than: "kill him or burn him". But Allah saved him from the fire. These are signs for people who believe.
And [Abraham] said: "Indeed, it is to cement bonds between yourselves in this present life, that you have adopted idols, besides Allah. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, some will reject others, and some will curse others, while you will have Fire for your refuge, will have no protectors.
Lot believed in him. He said, "I am emigrating to my Lord, for He is the Almighty, the Wise."
We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and placed in his descendants the prophecy and the Book. We gave him his reward here on earth, while in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
And Lot, when he said to his people, "Truly, you are committing turpitude where no one in the universe has gone before you.
Will you have carnal intercourse with males? Will you practice brigandage? Will you commit the blameworthy in your assembly?" But his people made no other answer than "Let the punishment of Allah come to us, if you are among the truthful."
He said, "Lord, give me victory over this corrupting people."
And when Our Angels brought Abraham the good news, they said, "We are going to destroy the inhabitants of this city, for its inhabitants are unjust."
He said, "But Lot is there." They said, "We know perfectly well who lives there, and we will certainly save him and his family, except his wife, who will be among those who will perish."
And when Our Angels came to Lot, he was grieved for them, and felt unable to protect them. They said to him, "Do not be afraid and do not grieve... We will save you and your family, except your wife, who will be among those who will perish.
We will bring punishment from heaven to the inhabitants of this city, for their perversity."
And certainly, We have left (from the ruins of this city) a clear sign (of warning) for people who understand.
Similarly, to the Madyan (We sent) their brother Chuayb who said to them: "O my people, worship Allah and wait on the Last Day, and do not sow corruption on the earth."
But they called him a liar. The cataclysm seized them, and in the morning they lay lifeless in their homes.
In the same way, (We annihilated) the 'Aad and the Thamud. - You see it clearly through their dwellings - The Devil, however, had beautified their deeds, so much so that he drove them away from the Path; they were nevertheless invited to be clear-sighted.
In the same way, (We destroyed) Korah, Pharaoh, and Haman. While Moses brought them proofs, they became proud on earth. And they couldn't escape [Us].
So We seized each one for his sin: there were some on whom We sent a hurricane; there were some that the Cri seized; there were some whom We caused to be swallowed up by the earth; and there were some whom We drowned. However, Allah is not such as to harm them; but they have done harm to themselves.
Those who have taken protectors besides Allah are like the spider that has given itself home. However, the most fragile house is that of the spider. If only they knew!
Allah knows everything that they invoke besides Him. And He is the Almighty, the Wise.
These are the parables that We quote to the people; however, only scholars understand them.
It is for a good reason that Allah created the heavens and the earth. This is proof for believers.
Recite what is revealed to you from the Book and perform Salah. In truth, Salat preserves against turpitude and blameworthiness. The remembrance of Allah is certainly the greatest thing. And Allah knows what you are doing.
And argue only in the best way with the People of the Book, except those of them who are unjust. And say, "We believe in what has been sent down to us and down to you, while our God and your God is the same, and to Him we submit."
This is how We sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you. Those to whom We have given the Book believe in it. And among these, there are some who believe in it. Only the disbelievers deny Our verses.
And before that, you didn't recite any books and you didn't write any with your right hand. Otherwise, those who deny the truth would have had doubts.
Rather, it consists of obvious verses, (preserved) in the breasts of those to whom knowledge has been given. And only the unrighteous deny Our verses.
And they said, "Why have not wonders been sent down upon him from his Lord?" Say: "The wonders are with Allah. I'm just a clear warning."
Is it not enough for them, then, that We have sent down the Book upon you and that it is recited to them? There is certainly a mercy and a reminder to people who believe.
Say: "Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you." He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. And as for those who believe in falsehood and do not believe in Allah, they will be the losers.
And they ask you to hasten [the coming] of punishment. If there had not been a fixed term, the punishment would certainly have come to them. And certainly, it will come to them suddenly, without them being aware of it.
They ask you to hasten [the coming] of punishment, while Hell surrounds the disbelievers on all sides.
The day when the chastisement will envelop them from above and under their feet. He will say to them, "Taste what you were doing."
O My servants who had believed! My land is very vast. Worship Me, then!
Every soul will taste death. Then you will be brought back to Us.
And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We will certainly set them upstairs in Paradise under which the streams flow, to dwell there forever. What a fine reward is that of those who do good,
who endure, and put their trust in their Lord!
How many beasts do not take care of their own food! It is Allah who feeds them and you. And He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
If you ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth, and subdued the sun and the moon?" they will most certainly say, "Allah." How is it that they then turn away (from the straight path)?
Allah dispenses His gifts to whomever He wills among His servants. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing.
If you ask them, "Who sent down water from heaven with which He revived the earth after His death?" they will most certainly say, "Allah." Say: "Praise be to Allah." But most of them do not reason.
This life here below is nothing but fun and play. The Abode of the Beyond is certainly true life. If only they knew!
When they get on a boat, they invoke Allah and worship Him exclusively. Once He has saved them [from the dangers of the sea by bringing them back] to dry land, behold, they give [Him] associates.
Let them deny what we have given them and enjoy the goods of this world! They will know soon!
Do they not see that We have really made a safe sanctuary [Makkah], while all around them people are being taken away? Will they then believe falsehood and deny the blessings of Allah?
And what worse unrighteous person than the one who invents a lie against Allah, or who denies the Truth when it reaches him? Is it not in Hell a dwelling place for the disbelievers?
And as for those who strive for Our cause, We will certainly guide them in Our paths. Verily, Allah is with the doers.
Alif, Lâm, Mîm.
The Romans have been defeated,
in the neighboring country, and after their defeat they will be the victors,
in a few years. To Allah belongs the commandment, at the beginning and at the end, and on that day the Believers will rejoice
of Allah's help. He helps whomever He wills and He is the Almighty, the All-Merciful.
This is the promise of Allah. Allah never breaks His promise, but most people don't know.
They know an aspect of the present life, while they are inattentive to the hereafter.
Have they not meditated within themselves? Allah created the heavens and the earth and what is between them, only rightly and for a fixed time. Many people, however, do not believe in the encounter with their Lord.
Have they not traveled the earth to see what has become of those who lived before them? They surpassed them in power, and had ploughed and peopled the earth much more than they did themselves. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. It is not Allah who wronged them; but they wronged themselves.
Then evil was the end of those who did evil, having called the verses of Allah lies and mocked them.
It is Allah who begins creation; then He makes it again; then you will be brought back to Him.
And on the day when the Hour comes, the criminals will be struck with despair.
And they will not have intercessors among those whom they associated [with Allah], and they will even deny their gods.
On the day when the Hour comes, on that day they will separate [from one another].
Those who believe and do good works will rejoice in a garden;
and as for those who do not believe and treat Our signs as lies, as well as the meeting in the Hereafter, they will be led to punishment.
Glorify Allah, therefore, night and morning!
To Him all praise in the heavens and on earth, in the afternoon and in the middle of the day.
From the dead He brings out the living, and from the living He brings forth the dead. And He gives life to the earth after his death. And this is how you will be brought out.
Among His signs: He created you from the earth, and then you are men who are scattered [in the world].
And among His signs He has created wives from you, for you, so that you may live in peace with them, and He has placed affection and kindness between you. There is evidence in this for people who think.
And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variety of your idioms and colors. There is evidence for the learned in this.
And among His signs is your sleep night and day, and also your quest for His grace. There is evidence in this for people who hear.
And among His signs He shows you lightning with fear (of lightning) and hope (of rain), and sends down from heaven water with which He restores life to the earth after its death. There is evidence in this for reasoning people.
And among His signs the heavens and the earth are maintained by His order; then when He calls you with a call, behold, you will arise from the earth.
To Him all who are in heaven and earth: all are entirely subject to Him.
And it is He who begins creation and then remakes it; and it is easier for Him. He has absolute transcendence in heaven and on earth. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
He has told you a parable of yourselves: Have you associated your slaves with what We have given you, so that you may all be equal [in the right of property] and fear them [as much as you fear one another]? This is how We set forth Our verses for reasoning people.
Those who have been unjust have rather followed their own passions, without knowing. Who can guide the one whom Allah leads astray? And they have no protector for them.
Direct your whole being to religion exclusively [for Allah], this is the nature that Allah originally gave to men - no change in Allah's creation. This is the religion of righteousness; But most people don't know.
Return repentant to Him; fear Him, perform Salah and do not be among the associates,
among those who divided their religion and became sects, each party exulting in what it held.
And when evil befalls people, they call upon their Lord by returning to Him repentant. And if He gives them a taste of mercy from Him, behold, some of them give their Lord associates,
so that they become ungrateful to what We have given them. "And enjoy. You'll know soon."
Have We sent down upon them such authority (a Book) that it speaks of what they associated with Him?
And when We give people a taste of mercy, they rejoice. But if a misfortune befalls them because of what their own hands have prepared, then they despair.
Have they not seen that Allah dispenses His gifts or restricts them to whomever He wills? There is evidence in this for people who believe.
Give therefore the next of kin his due, as well as the poor, and the traveler in distress. This is better for those who seek the face of Allah (His satisfaction); and they are the ones who succeed.
Whatever you give for usury to increase your wealth at the expense of the goods of others does not increase them in the sight of Allah, but what you give as Zakat, while seeking the Face of Allah (His satisfaction)... They will see [their rewards] multiplied.
It is Allah who created you and fed you. Then He will kill you, and then He will give you life again. Are there any of your partners who do any of that? Glory be to Him! He transcends what is associated with Him.
Corruption has appeared on land and in the sea because of what people have done with their own hands; so that [Allah] may make them taste some of what they have done; perhaps they will return (to Allah).
Say: "Go through the earth and see what has become of those who lived before. Most of them were associates."
Direct your whole being to the religion of righteousness, before the day comes from Allah that cannot be postponed. On that day [people] will be divided:
Whoever disbelieves will suffer the consequences of his unfaithfulness. And whoever has done good... It is for themselves that they are preparing (their future),
so that [Allah] may reward with His grace those who believe and do good deeds. Verily, He does not love infidels.
Among His signs, He sends the winds as heralds, to make you taste His mercy and for the ship to sail, by His command, and for you to seek His grace. Maybe you'd be grateful!
We have indeed sent messengers before you to their people, and they brought them proofs. We took revenge on those who committed the crimes [of denial]; and it was Our duty to help believers.
Allah is the One who sends the winds that raise clouds; then He spreads them out in heaven as He wills; and He tears them to pieces. Then you see the rain coming out of their depths. And when He reaches with her whom He wills among His servants, they rejoice,
even if they were before, before he was brought down on them, desperate.
So look at the effects of Allah's mercy how He restores life to the earth after its death. He is the One who revives the dead, and He is Omnipotent.
And if We send a wind and they see [their vegetation] turn yellow, they remain ungrateful after that.
Verily, you do not make the dead hear; and you do not make the deaf hear the call, if they go away with their backs turned.
You are not the one who guides the blind out of their error. You only give voice to those who believe in Our verses and who are then entirely submissive.
Allah is the One who created you weak; then after weakness, He gives you strength; then after strength, He reduces you to weakness and old age: He creates what He wills and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.
And on the day when the Hour comes, the criminals will swear that they have stayed only an hour. Thus they have been turned away (from the truth);
while those to whom knowledge and faith were given will say: "You have dwelt according to the decree of Allah, until the Day of Resurrection, this is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know."
Therefore, on that day, excuses will not be of use to the wrongdoers, and they will not be asked to seek to please [Allah].
And in this Qur'an, We have certainly cited examples of all kinds for people. And if you bring them a wonder, those who do not believe will say, "Surely you are only impostors."
This is how Allah seals the hearts of those who do not know.
So be patient, for Allah's promise is truth. And let not those who do not firmly believe shake you!
Alif, Lâm, Mîm.
These are the verses of the Book full of wisdom,
it is a guide and a mercy to the beneficents,
who perform Salah, pay Zakat, and believe with certainty in the Hereafter.
These are on the right path of their Lord and they are the blessed.
And among men there is [someone] who, without knowledge, buys pleasant speeches to lead astray from the path of Allah and to mock Him. Such will suffer a degrading punishment.
And when Our verses are recited to him, he turns his back with pride, as if he had not heard them, as if there were a weight in his ears. Tell him, then, of a painful punishment.
Those who believe and do good deeds will have the Gardens of Earthly Delights,
to dwell there forever, - it is indeed a promise of Allah. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
He created the heavens without pillars for you to see; and He has driven firm mountains into the earth to keep it from toppling over with you; and He has propagated animals of all kinds there. And from heaven We sent down water, with which We caused productive plants to grow in pairs of all kinds.
"This is the creation of Allah. Show Me then what those who are outside of Him have created?" But the unjust are obviously misguided.
We did give Luqman wisdom: "Be thankful to Allah, for whoever is grateful, is grateful only for himself; as for the one who is ungrateful... Verily, Allah dispenses with all things, and He is worthy of praise."
And when Luqman said to his son while exhorting him, "O my son, do not give a partner to Allah, for association with [Allah] is truly a great injustice."
We commanded man [to do goodness to] his father and mother; his mother carried him [suffering for him] sentence after sentence: he was weaned at two years of age. "Be grateful to Me as well as to your parents. To Me is the destination.
And if both of them force you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them; but stay with them here on earth in a proper way. And follow the path of the one who turns to Me. To Me, then, is your return, and then I will inform you of what you were doing."
"O my child, even if it be the weight of a mustard seed, at the bottom of a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring him. Allah is infinitely Gentle and Perfectly Knowing.
O my son, perform Salah, command what is proper, forbid what is blameworthy, and endure what happens to you with patience. This is the resolution to be made in every company!
And do not turn your face away from men, nor tread the earth with arrogance: for Allah does not love the presumptuous full of glory.
Be modest in your approach, and lower your voice, for the most hated of voices is the voice of donkeys."
Do you not see that Allah has subdued to you what is in the heavens and on the earth? And He has showered you with His apparent and hidden benefits. And among the people there are those who argue about Allah, without knowledge, guidance, or the Enlightening Book.
And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has sent down," they say, "Rather, we follow what we found our ancestors on." Is it then even if the Devil called them to the punishment of the furnace?
And whoever submits his being to Allah, while being beneficent, is really clinging to the firmest handle. The end of all things belongs to Allah.
Whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief afflict you: to Us will be their return, and We will tell them what they were doing. Allah knows well the contents of the breasts.
We give them enjoyment for a short time; then We will force them to a severe punishment.
If you ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" they will certainly say, "Allah." Say: "Praise be to Allah." But most of them don't know.
To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth. Allah is the Self-Sufficient One, He is the One Worthy of Praise!
Even if all the trees of the earth were to turn into calames [pens for writing], even if the ocean were an ocean of ink where seven other oceans converged, the words of Allah would not be exhausted. For Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Your creation and resurrection [to all] are [as easy to Allah] as if it were one soul. Verily, Allah is Hearer and Clear-sighted.
Have you not seen that Allah brings night into day, and that He brings day into night, and that He has subdued the sun and the moon, each one of whom continues his course to a fixed time? And Allah is Fully Aware of what you do.
This is because Allah is the Truth, and whatever they invoke besides Him is the False, and Allah is the High, the Great.
Have you not seen that it is by the grace of Allah that the ship sails in the sea, so that He may show you His wonders? There are proofs in this for every patient and grateful man.
When a wave covers them like shadows, they invoke Allah, devoting their worship exclusively to Him; and when He saves them, by bringing them back to dry land, some of them become reluctant; but only the great traitor and the great ungrateful deny Our signs.
O men! Fear your Lord and dread a day when the father will answer for nothing for his child, nor the child for his father. Allah's promise is truth. So don't let this life deceive you, and may the Deceiver (Satan) not mislead you about Allah!
The knowledge of the Hour is with Allah; and it is He who causes the saving rain to fall; and He knows what's in the wombs. And no one knows what he will acquire tomorrow, and no one knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Knowing.
Alif, Lâm, Mîm.
The Revelation of the Book, no doubt about it, emanates from the Lord of the universe.
Will they say that he (Muhammad) invented it? This, on the contrary, is the truth coming from your Lord, that you should warn a people to whom no warner before you has come, that they may be guided.
Allah, who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days. Then He established himself "Istawâ" on the Throne. Apart from Him, you have neither an ally nor an intercessor. Don't you remember?
From heaven to earth, He administers the matter, which then ascends to Him in a day equivalent to a thousand years of your calculation.
He is the Knower of the unknown and visible worlds, the Mighty, the Merciful,
who has done well all that He has created. And He began the creation of man out of clay,
then He drew His offspring from a drop of vile water [the semen];
then He gave it its perfect form and breathed into it with His Spirit. And He has assigned you hearing, eyes, and heart. How little you are grateful!
And they say, "When we are lost in the earth [in the form of dust], will we become a new creation again?" Moreover, they do not believe in the encounter with their Lord.
Say: "The Angel of Death who is in charge of you will put you to death. Then you will be brought back to your Lord."
If only you then saw the criminals [appear] with their heads bowed before their Lord! "Our Lord, We have seen and heard, send us away, therefore, that we may do good; We believe [now] with certainty."
"If We wished, We would bring to each soul his guidance. But the word from Me must be fulfilled: "I will fill Hell with jinn and men together."
"Taste it! For forgetting the meeting of your day that is here. We too have forgotten you. Taste eternal punishment for what you did."
Only those who are reminded of Our verses fall prostrate and, with praise to their Lord, praise His glory and are not puffed up with pride.
They tear themselves from their beds to call on their Lord, out of fear and hope; and they make a largesse of what We attribute to them.
No being knows what has been reserved for them as a rejoicing for the eyes, as a reward for what they worked!
Is the believer comparable to the perverse? (No), they are not equal.
Those who believe and do good deeds will have their residence in the Gardens of Refuge as a reward for what they have done.
And as for those who have been perverse, their refuge will be Fire: whenever they want to come out of it, they will be brought back to it, and it will be said to them, "Taste the punishment of the Fire which you refused to believe."
We will certainly give them a taste of the punishment here on earth, before the great chastisement, so that they may return (to the straight path)!
Who is more unjust than the one who is reminded of the verses of Allah and then turns away from them? We will certainly take revenge on the criminals.
We did indeed give Moses the Book - so do not be in doubt about your encounter with it - and assigned him as a guide to the Children of Israel.
And We appointed leaders from among them who guided (the people) by Our command as long as they endured and firmly believed in Our verses.
Your Lord will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection what they disagree on.
Is it not an indication to them that before them We have destroyed so many generations in whose houses they walk? There is evidence for this! Will they not listen?
Have they not seen that We push water to a dry soil, and then We bring out a crop that they and their cattle eat? Do they not see, then?
And they say, "When will this victory come, if you are truthful?"
Say: "On the Day of Victory it will be useless for the infidels to believe! And no deadline will be given to them."
Get away from them and wait. They too remain in waiting.
O Prophet! Fear Allah and do not obey the infidels and the hypocrites, for Allah remains All-Knowing and Wise.
And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. For Allah is the Knower of what you do.
And put your trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient for you as a protector.
Allah has not placed two hearts in a man's chest. He did not equate your wives with your mothers, "You are as unlawful to me as my mother's back." He has not made your adopted children your own children. These are words [that come out] of your mouth. But Allah speaks the truth and it is He who points [man] in the right direction.
Call them by the name of their fathers, for it is more equitable in the sight of Allah. But if you do not know their fathers, then consider them your brothers in religion or your allies. There is no blame on you for what you do by mistake, but (you will be blamed for) what your hearts do deliberately. Allah, however, is Forgiving and Merciful.
The Prophet has more right over the believers than they have over themselves; and his wives are their mothers. Ties of consanguinity have precedence [in inheritance] between the believers [of Medina] and the emigrants [of Makkah] according to the Book of Allah, unless you make a suitable will in favor of your brothers in religion. And it's written in the Book.
When We pledged the prophets, as well as you, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary, and We made a solemn pledge of them,
so that [Allah] may question the truthful about their sincerity. And He has prepared a painful punishment for the infidels.
O you who believe! Remember the blessing of Allah upon you, when troops came to you and We sent against them a wind and troops that you did not see. Allah remains Clear-sighted about what you do.
When they came to you from above and below, and the eyes were troubled, and the hearts went up to the throats, and you made all kinds of assumptions about Allah...
The believers were then tried and shaken with a harsh shock.
And when the hypocrites and those who have sickness [doubt] in their hearts said: "Allah and His Messenger have promised us nothing but deception."
Similarly, a group of them said, "People of Yathrib! Don't stay here. Go back [home]." A group of them asked the Prophet for permission to leave, saying, "Our homes are unprotected," when they were not: they only wanted to flee.
And if a breakthrough had been made on them from the flanks of the city and then they had been asked to renounce their faith, they would certainly have accepted, and would not have been long in coming,
whereas before they had made a commitment to Allah that they would not turn their backs. And he will be asked to account for any commitment to Allah.
Say: "Flight will never be of any use to you if it is death (without fighting) or murder (in battle) that you are fleeing; in that case, you will enjoy (life) only a short time."
Say: "Who is there who can protect you from Allah, if He wishes to harm you or if He wants to show you mercy?" And they will not find for themselves besides Allah, neither ally nor helper.
Verily, Allah knows those of you who raise obstacles, and those who say to their brothers, "Come to us," while they show little zeal in battle.
stingy with you. Then, when fear strikes, you see them look at you with rolled back eyes, like those of someone who has fainted for fear of death. Once the fear has passed, they lacerate you with sharp tongues, while they are stingy at doing good. They never believed. Allah, therefore, makes their deeds vain. And this is easy for Allah.
They think that the coalition has not left. But if the coalition returned, [these people] would like to be nomads among the Bedouins and [would] be content to ask for your news. If they were among you, they would have fought very little.
Indeed, you have in the Messenger of Allah an excellent model for anyone who hopes in Allah and the Last Day and invokes Allah frequently.
And when the believers saw the coalition, they said, "This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us; and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth." And this only increased their faith and submission.
There are men among the believers who have been sincere in their commitment to Allah. Some of them have reached their end, and others are still waiting; and they have not varied in the least;
so that Allah may reward the truthful for their sincerity, and punish, if He wills, the hypocrites, or accept their repentance. For Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And Allah has sent away the infidels with their rage without them having obtained any good, and Allah has spared the believers the fight. Allah is Mighty and Mighty.
And He brought down from their fortresses those of the People of the Book who had supported them [the coalition], and He threw terror into their hearts; a group of them you killed, and a group took you prisoner.
And He has made you inherit their land, their dwellings, their goods, and also a land which you had not trodden. And Allah is Omnipotent.
O Prophet! Say to your wives, "If it is this life that you desire and its adornment, then come! I will give you [the means] to enjoy it and set you free [by divorce] without prejudice.
But if it is Allah whom you want and His Messenger and the Last Abode, Allah has prepared a great reward for the beneficent among you.
O wives of the Prophet! Whoever among you commits proven turpitude, the punishment will be doubled twice! And this is easy for Allah.
And the one among you who is completely submissive to Allah and His Messenger and does good, We will give her twice her reward, and We have prepared for her a generous allotment.
O wives of the Prophet! You are not comparable to any other woman. If you are pious, do not be too complacent in your language, so that he whose heart is sick [the hypocrite] will not covet you. And use decent language.
Stay in your homes; and do not exhibit yourself in the manner of the women before Islam (Jâhiliyah). Perform Salah, pay Zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only wants to rid you of all defilement, O people of the household, and wants to cleanse you completely.
And keep in your memories what is recited in your homes from the verses of Allah and wisdom. Allah is Gentle and All-Knowing.
Muslims, men and women who believe, who are obedient, loyal and loyal, who endure, who fear and fear, who give alms, who fast, who are guardians of their chastity and guardians, who often invoke Allah and who supplication: Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward for them.
It is not up to a believer, once Allah and His Messenger have decided one thing, to still have a choice in how they act. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has gone astray, indeed by a clear error.
When you said to the one whom Allah had bestowed with blessings, just as you had bestowed upon him, "Keep your wife to yourself and fear Allah," and you were hiding in your soul what Allah was going to make public. You feared people, and Allah is more worthy of your fear. And when Zayd had ceased all intercourse with her, We made you marry her, so that there would be no hindrance for the believers to marry the wives of their adopted sons, when they cease all intercourse with them. Allah's command must be carried out.
There is no reproach to be made against the Prophet in that Allah has imposed on him, in accordance with the laws established for those who lived before. Allah's commandment is an inescapable decree.
Those who communicated the messages of Allah, feared Him and feared none other than Allah. And Allah is sufficient to keep track of everything.
Muhammad was never the father of one of your men, but the Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets. Allah is All-Knowing.
O you who believe! Evoke Allah abundantly,
and glorify Him at the dawn and at the end of the day.
It is He who prays over you, together with His Angels, that He may bring you out of darkness into light; and He is Merciful to believers.
Their greeting on the day they meet Him will be: "Salam" [peace], and He has prepared a generous reward for them.
O Prophet! We have sent you to witness, to herald, to warn,
calling (people) to Allah, by His permission; and like an illuminating lamp.
And give good news to the believers that they will receive great grace from Allah.
And do not obey the infidels and hypocrites, do not pay attention to their wickedness, and put your trust in Allah and Allah is sufficient as your protector.
O you who believe! When you marry women of faith and then divorce them before you have touched them, you cannot impose a waiting period on them. Give them the enjoyment [of property] and set them free [by divorce] without prejudice.
O Prophet! We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have given their mahr (dowry), what you have lawfully possessed among the captives [or slaves] whom Allah has destined for you, the daughters of your paternal uncle, the daughters of your paternal aunts, the daughters of your maternal uncle, and the daughters of your maternal aunts, those who had emigrated with you,  and any believing woman if she gives her person to the Prophet, provided that the Prophet consents to marry her: this is a privilege for you, to the exclusion of other believers. We know what We have imposed on them concerning their wives and the slaves they own, so that there will be no blame against you. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
You make whoever you want wait for them, and you host whomever you want in your home. Then you are not reproached if you invite to your home one of those whom you had rejected. This is what is most likely to rejoice them, to save them all sorrow, and to make them accept with a good heart what you have given them all. Allah knows, however, what is in your hearts. And Allah is All-Knowing and Forgiving.
It is no longer lawful for you to take [other] wives, nor to change wives, even if their beauty pleases you; - except for the slaves you own. And Allah observes all things.
O you who believe! Do not enter the dwellings of the Prophet unless you are invited to a meal, without being there waiting for it to be cooked. But when you are called, then come in. Then, when you have eaten, disperse yourselves, without trying to make yourselves familiar to talk. It hurt the Prophet, but he was embarrassed to dismiss you, whereas Allah does not mind the truth. And if you ask them (his wives) for any object, ask them behind a curtain: it is purer for your hearts and their hearts; you must not cause pain to the Messenger of Allah, nor should you ever marry his wives after him; it would be, in the eyes of Allah, a great sin.
Whether you divulge something or hide it,... Allah remains All-Knowing.
No grievance against them concerning their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their wives and the slaves they own. And fear Allah. For Allah is the witness of all things.
Verily, Allah and His angels pray upon the Prophet; O you who believe, pray upon him and address your greetings to him.
Those who offend Allah and His Messenger, Allah curses them in this world, as in the Hereafter, and prepares for them a degrading punishment.
And those who offend believers without their having deserved it, are burdening themselves with slander and obvious sin.
O Prophet! Tell your wives, your daughters, and the wives of believers to bring their large veils over them, and they will be more quickly recognized and will avoid being offended. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Verily, if the hypocrites, those with heart disease, and the alarmists in Madinah do not cease, We will incite you against them, and then they will stay there only a short time in your neighborhood.
They are cursed. Wherever they are found, they will be taken and killed mercilessly:
This was the law established by Allah for those who lived before and you will not find any change in the law of Allah.
People ask you about the Hour. Say: "His knowledge is exclusive to Allah." What do you know? It may be that the Hour is near.
Allah cursed the infidels and prepared a furnace for them,
so that they may remain there forever, without finding allies or helpers.
On the day when their faces are turned and turned back in the Fire, they will say, "Alas for us! If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger!"
And they said, "Lord, we have obeyed our leaders and our nobles. So they are the ones who have led us astray from the Path.
O our Lord, inflict twice the punishment on them and curse them with a great curse."
O you who believe! Do not be like those who offended Moses. Allah declared him innocent of their accusations, because he was honorable in the sight of Allah.
O you who believe! Fear Allah and speak righteously,
so that He may improve your actions and forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger is indeed very successful.
We had proposed to the heavens, the earth, and the mountains the responsibility (to bear the burdens of doing good and avoiding evil). They refused to carry it and were afraid of it, while the man took care of it; for he is very unjust and very ignorant.
So that Allah may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the associates, and Allah may accept the repentance of the believers. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
Praise be to Allah, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. And praise be to Him in the Hereafter. And He is the Wise, the Perfected Knower.
He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it, what comes down from heaven and what rises again. And He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.
Those who do not believe say, "The Hour will not come to us." Say: "By my Lord! Most certainly, it will come to you. [My Lord] the Knower of the Unknowable. Nothing escapes Him, even from the weight of an atom in the heavens, as on earth. And there is nothing smaller or greater, that is not written in an explicit Book,
so that He may reward those who believe and do good works. For these, there will be forgiveness and a generous donation.
And those who strive to make Our verses vain, they will have the punishment of a painful torment.
And those to whom knowledge has been given see that what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth that guides to the path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy.
And those who do not believe said, "Do you want to be shown a man who will tell you that when you are completely disintegrated, you will undoubtedly reappear as a new creation?
Is he inventing a lie against Allah? Or is he crazy?" [No], but those who do not believe in the hereafter are doomed to punishment and distant error.
Do they not then see what is heaven and earth before and behind them? If We wished, We would cause the earth to swallow them up, or pieces of heaven to fall upon them. There is a proof in this for every repentant servant.
We have indeed granted a favor to David from Us: O mountains and birds, repeat with him (the praises of Allah). And for him, We have softened the iron,
(telling him): "Make complete chainmail and measure the stitches well." And do good. I am a Clairvoyant about what you are doing.
And to Solomon (We have subdued) the wind, the morning course of which is equivalent to a month's journey, and the evening journey is also a month. And for him We have made the spring of copper flow. And among the jinn there are some who worked under him, by permission of his Lord. Whoever of them, however, deviated from Our command, We gave him a taste of the punishment of the furnace.
They made for him what he wanted: shrines, statues, trays like basins, and well-anchored pots. - "O family of David, work out of gratitude," while there have been few of My servants who are grateful.
Then, when We decided on his death, there was only the "beast of the earth" to warn them of his death, which gnawed at his cane. Then when he collapsed, it became evident to the jinn that if they really knew the unknown, they would not have remained in the humiliating torment [of servitude].
There was certainly a Sign in their dwellings for the tribe of Sheba': two gardens, one on the right and the other on the left. "Eat of what your Lord has given you, and be grateful to Him: a good land and a Forgiving Lord."
But they turned away. We unleashed the flooding of the Dam against them, and changed their two gardens into two gardens of bitter fruits, tamarisk and a few jujube trees.
Thus rewarded Us for their disbelief. Are We able to punish anyone other than the disbeliever?
And We had placed other prominent cities between them and the cities that We had blessed, and We had evaluated the stages of travel between them. "Travel between them for nights and days, in safety."
Then they said, "Lord, lengthen the distances between our stages," and they wronged themselves. We therefore made them the subjects of legend and disintegrated them completely. There are warnings in this for all, great endurance and great grateful.
And Satan has most certainly made his conjecture about them true. So they followed him, except for a group of believers.
And yet he had no power over them except that We wanted to distinguish between the one who believed in the Hereafter and the one who doubted. Your Lord, however, ensures the safeguarding of all things.
Say: "Invoke those whom you claim besides Allah [to be gods]. They do not even possess the weight of an atom, neither in the heavens nor on the earth. They have never been associated with their creation and He has no one among them to support Him."
Intercession with Him benefits only the one for whom He permits it. When fear has then passed from their hearts, they will say, "What has your Lord said?" They will answer, "The Truth; He is the Sublime, the Great."
Say: "Who feeds you from heaven and earth?" Say: "Allah. It is we or you who are on the right path, or in a manifest error."
Say: "You will not be questioned about the crimes we have committed, and we will not be questioned about what you are doing."
Say: "Our Lord will bring us together, and then He will decide between us, with the truth, for He is the Great Judge, the All-Knowing."
Say: "Show me those whom you have given Him as associates. Well, no! Rather, it is He, Allah, the Mighty, the Wise."
And We have sent you only as a herald and warner for all mankind. But most people don't know.
And they say, "When will this promise come, if you are truthful?"
Say: "The appointment is for a day that you will not be able to delay for an hour, nor bring forward."
And those who disbelieved said: "We will never believe in this Qur'an or in what came before it." And if you could only see when the unrighteous will stand before their Lord, sending the word back to one another! Those who were considered weak will say to those who were proud: "Without you, we would certainly have been believers."
Those who were proud will say to those whom they considered weak, "Were we the ones who pushed you away from the right direction after it came to you? But you were more like criminals."
And those who were considered weak will say to those who were proud: "It was your ploy, rather, night and day, to command us not to believe in Allah and to give Him equals." And they will hide their regret when they see the punishment. We will put shackles around the necks of those who have disbelieved: would we reward them other than according to what they worked?"
And We have not sent any warner into a city without its well-to-do people saying, "We do not believe the message with which you are sent."
And they said, "We have more wealth and more children, and we will not be punished."
Say: "My Lord generously dispenses His gifts to whomever He wills. But most people don't know."
Neither your possessions nor your children will bring you close to Us. Except the one who believes and works in good. They will have a double reward for what they have been doing, while they will be safe on the upper floors (of Paradise).
And as for those who strive to make Our verses ineffective, they will be forced to present themselves for punishment.
Say: "My Lord dispenses His gifts generously or restrained to whom He wills among His servants. And whatever you spend [in good], He replaces it, and He is the Best of Givers."
And someday He will gather them all. Then He will say to the Angels, "Was it you that these people worshipped?"
They will say, "Glory to You! You are our Ally apart from them. Rather, they worshipped the jinn, in whom most of them believed.
On that day, therefore, you will have no means of benefiting or harming one another, while We will say to the unjust: "Taste the punishment of the Fire, which you called a lie."
And when Our edifying verses are recited to them, they say, 'This is only a man who wants to turn you away from what your forefathers worshipped.'" And they say, "This (the Qur'an) is just a made-up lie." And those who do not believe say of the Truth when it comes to them: "This is only obvious magic!"
[Yet] We didn't give them books to study. And We have not sent them any warner before you.
Those before them had [also] denied (their messengers). [The Meccans] have not attained a tenth of what We have given them [in strength and wealth]. They called My Messengers liars. And what a reprobation was mine!
Say: "I exhort you only to one thing: that for the sake of Allah you get up, in pairs or singly, and then think. Your companion (Muhammad) is not possessed at all, but he is only a warning to you of severe punishment."
Say: "What I ask of you as a salary is for yourselves. For my salary belongs only to Allah. He is a Witness of all things."
Say: "Verily, my Lord speaks the Truth, [to His messengers], He is the Perfect Knower of the unknowable."
Say: "The truth [Islam] has come. And the False [disbelief] cannot begin or renew anything."
Say: "If I go astray, I go astray only at my own expense; whereas if I guide myself, then it is thanks to what My Lord reveals to me, for He is Hearing and Near."
If you see them when they are seized with fear, - there is no escape for them - and they will be seized at close quarters!
Then they will say, "We believe in him." - But how will they attain faith from so far away?
whereas before they had actually disbelieved in it and they offend the stranger from a distant place!
They will be prevented from attaining what they desire, as was done before with their fellow-men, for they were in deep doubt.
Praise be to Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who has made the angels messengers with two, three or four wings. He adds to creation what He wills, for Allah is Omnipotent.
What Allah grants in mercy to people, there is no one who can hold back. And what He retains, there is no one to release after Him. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.
O men! Remember the blessing of Allah upon you: is there a Creator besides Allah who from heaven and earth bestows your sustenance on you? There is no god but Him! How can you turn away [from this truth]?
And if they call you a liar, surely the Messengers have been called liars before you. To Allah, however, everything is brought back.
O men! Allah's promise is truth. Do not let this life deceive you, and let the great deceiver, (Satan) not deceive you about Allah!
The Devil is an enemy to you. Take him for your enemy, then. He only calls his supporters to be people of the Furnace.
Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment, while those who believe and do good deeds will have forgiveness and a great reward.
What! The one whose evil deed has been embellished to the point that he sees it beautiful...? - But Allah leads astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills - Let not your soul be filled with regret for them: Allah is Perfectly Knowledgeable of what they make.
And it is Allah who sends the winds that raise a cloud which We then push to a dead land; then We give life to the earth after its death. This is how the Resurrection will take place!
Whoever wants power (let him seek it from Allah) for all power is Allah's: to Him ascends the good word, and He exalts good deeds. And as for those who plot evil deeds, they will have a severe punishment. However, their scheme is doomed to failure.
And Allah created you from the earth, then from a drop of semen, and then He established you into couples. No female bears or gives birth without His knowledge. And no existence is prolonged or shortened without it being recorded in a book. This is really easy for Allah.
The two seas are not identical: [the water of] the one is drinkable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, and the other is salty, bitter. However, from each you eat fresh flesh, and you extract an ornament which you wear. And you see the vessel cleaving the water noisily, so that you may seek some of His grace's products. Maybe you'll be grateful!
He makes night penetrate the day and day penetrate the night. And He subdued the sun and the moon. Each of them is moving towards a fixed term. This is Allah your Lord: to Him belongs the kingdom, while those whom you invoke besides Him are not even masters of the skin of a date stone.
If you call upon them, they do not hear your supplication; and even if they heard, they would not be able to answer you. And on the Day of Judgment they will deny your association. No one can give you news like the One who is perfectly informed.
O men, you are the needy who need Allah, and it is Allah who dispenses with all things and He is the One worthy of praise.
If He willed, He would make you disappear, and bring forth a new creation.
And this is not difficult for Allah.
But no one will bear the burden of another. And if a soul overloaded [with sins] cries out for help, none of his burden will be borne by another even if he is a close relative. In fact, you warn only those who fear their Lord even though they do not see Him, and who perform Salah. And whoever purifies himself purifies himself only for himself, and to Allah is the destination.
The blind man and the seeer are not alike,
nor darkness and light,
nor the shade and the fiery heat.
In the same way, the living and the dead are not alike. Allah makes whomever He wills hear, while you [Muhammad] cannot make those who are in the tombs hear.
You are only a warner.
We have sent you with the Truth as a herald and warner. There is not a nation that has not already had a warner.
And if they call you a liar, well, those before them called (their Messengers) liars, while their Messengers brought them the proofs, the Writings and the Illuminating Book.
Then I seized those who disbelieved. And what a reprobation was mine!
Have you not seen that Allah sends down water from heaven? Then We bring forth fruits of different colors. And in the mountains, there are white and red furrows, of different colors, and excessively black rocks.
There are likewise different colors among men, animals, and cattle. Among His servants, only the scholars fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Mighty and Forgiving.
Those who recite the Book of Allah, perform Salah, and spend in secret and in public what We have allotted to them, hope in this way to carry on a trade that will never perish.
so that [Allah] may fully reward them and add His grace to them. He is Forgiving and Grateful.
And what We have revealed to you of the Book is the Truth confirming what came before it. Verily, Allah is Allainthetical and Knowingly Knowingly and Knowingly His servants.
Then We made those of Our servants whom We chose heirs of the Book. There are some among them who harm themselves, others who stand in the middle way, and others with Allah's permission anticipate [all others] in their good deeds; such is infinite grace
The Gardens of Eden where they will enter, adorned with gold bracelets and pearls; and there their garments are of silk.
And they will say: "Praise be to Allah, who has removed affliction from us. Our Lord is indeed Forgiving and Grateful.
It is He who has installed us, by His grace, in the Abode of stability, where no fatigue, no weariness touches us."
And those who have disbelieved will have the fire of Hell: they are not finished off to die; nothing is relieved of their torments. This is how We reward every obstinate denier.
And there they will cry out, "Lord, bring us out; We will do good, contrary to what we were doing." "Have We not given you a life long enough for the one who thinks to reflect? The alarm, however, had come to you. Well, taste (your punishment). For for the unjust, there is no helper."
Allah knows the Unknowable in the heavens and the earth. He knows the contents of the breasts.
It is He who has made you successors on earth. Whoever disbelieves, his disbelief will fall on him. Their disbelief only adds reproach to the disbelievers to their Lord. Their disbelief only adds loss to the disbelievers.
Say: "Do you see your associates whom you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they created from the earth. Were they associated with the creation of the heavens? Or have We brought them a Book that contains proofs [for what they do]." No! But it is only in deception that the unrighteous make promises to one another.
Allah holds back the heavens and the earth so that they do not collapse. And if they should sink, no one else after Him will be able to hold them back. He is Indulgent and Forgiving.
And they solemnly swore by Allah, that if a warner came to them, they would certainly be better guided than any other community. Then, when a warner (Muhammad) came to them, it only increased their repulsion,
by pride on earth and by treacherous maneuvers. However, the treacherous maneuver only envelops its own perpetrators. Are they then waiting for a different fate from that of the Ancients? But you will never find a change in Allah's rule, and you will never find a deviation in Allah's rule.
Have they never traveled the earth to see what has become of those who lived before them and who were more powerful than they? And nothing in heaven or on earth can reduce the authority of Allah. For He is indeed Omniscient, Omnipotent.
And if Allah were to attack people for what they acquire, He would not leave on the face [of the earth] any living being. But He gives them a period of time until a fixed term. Then when their end comes... (He will take hold of them) because Allah is Very Discerning over His servants.
Yâ Sîn.
By the Qur'an full of wisdom.
You (Muhammad) are indeed among the Messengers,
on a straight path.
It is a revelation from the Almighty, the Most Merciful,
so that you warn a people whose ancestors were not warned: therefore they are careless.
For the Word against most of them has been fulfilled, so they will not believe.
We will put shackles around their necks, and there will be some up to their chins: and now they will go with their heads raised.
and We will set a barrier before them and a barrier behind them; We will cover them with a veil, and behold, they will be able to see nothing.
They don't care whether you warn them or not: they will never believe.
You only warn the one who follows the Remembrance (the Qur'an), and fears the All-Merciful, even though he does not see Him. Announce to him forgiveness and a generous reward.
It is We who raise the dead and write down what they have done [for the Hereafter] and their traces. And We have enumerated everything in an explicit register.
Give them as an example the inhabitants of the city, when the envoys came to him.
When We sent them two [messengers] and they called them liars. Then we reinforced [them] with a third, and they said, "Truly, we are sent to you."
But they said, "You are just men like us. The Most Merciful has sent down nothing and you are only lying."
They [the messengers] said, "Our Lord knows that in truth we are sent to you,
and it is only incumbent on us to convey (our message) clearly."
They said, "We see in you an evil omen. If you do not stop, we will stone you and a painful punishment from us will come upon you."
They said, "Your bad omen is with yourselves. Do you (this is how you act) when you are reminded of it? But you are outrageous people!"
And from the end of the city a man came in all haste and said, "O my people, follow the messengers:
Follow those who don't ask you for any salary and are on the right track.
and why should I not worship Him who created me? And to Him you will be drawn.
Would I take gods besides Him? If the Most Merciful wishes me harm, their intercession will be of no use to me and they will not save me.
I will then be in an obvious way.
[But] I believe in your Lord. Listen to me, then."
Then it was said to him, "Enter Paradise." He said, "Oh, if only my people knew!
... for which reason my Lord has forgiven me and made me one of the honored."
And after him We sent down no army from heaven. We did not want to send anything down on his people.
It was only one Cry and now they are extinguished.
Alas for slaves [humans]! Never does it come to them that they don't scoff at.
Do they not see how many generations before them We have destroyed them? They will never return to their midst.
And all of them without exception will appear before Us.
A proof for them is the dead earth, to which We give life, and from which We bring forth grain from which they eat.
We have planted gardens of palm trees and vines and have caused springs to gush out,
so that they may eat of His fruit and of what their hands have produced. Won't they be grateful?
Praise be to Him who created all couples from what the earth grows, from themselves, and from what they do not know!
And a proof for them is the night. We skin them during the day and they are then in darkness.
and the sun runs to a lodging assigned to it; such is the determination of the Almighty, of the All-Knowing.
And the moon We have determined phases for it until it becomes like the old palm.
The sun cannot catch up with the moon, nor night precede the day; and each one sails in an orbit.
And (another) sign for them is that We have carried their descendants on the loaded boat;
and We created for them like men on which they ascend.
And if We will, We drown them; for them then, there is no helper and they will not be saved,
except by mercy on Our part, and as a pleasure for a time.
And when they are told, "Fear what is before you and what is behind you, so that you may have mercy"...
Now not a single proof comes to them, among the proofs of their Lord, that they do not turn away from it.
And when it is said to them, "Spend what Allah has given you," those who have disbelieved say to those who have believed, "Shall we feed someone whom Allah would have fed if He had willed? You are only in an obvious error."
And they say, "When will this promise be made, if you are truthful?"
They are only waiting for a single Cry to seize them while they are arguing.
They will therefore not be able to make a will or return to their families.
And they will blow into the Trunk, and behold, from the tombs they will rush to their Lord,
saying, "Woe to us! Who raised us from where we slept?" This is what the Most Merciful had promised; and the Messengers had spoken the truth.
It will be but one Cry, and behold, they will all be brought before Us.
On that day, no soul will be harmed in anything. And you will only be rewarded according to what you did.
The people of Paradise will be, on that day, in an occupation that fills them with happiness;
they and their wives are under shade, leaning on the couches.
There they will have fruit and they will have what they ask for,
"Salam" [peace and blessings of all]! Word from a Most Merciful Lord.
"O unjust! Stay away on this day!
Have I not urged you, children of Adam, not to worship the Devil? For he is truly an open enemy to you,
and [have I not urged you] to worship Me? This is a straight path.
And it has most certainly led many of you astray. Were you not reasoning?
This is the Hell that was promised to you.
Burn it today, for having disbelieved."
On that day We will seal their mouths, while their hands will speak to Us and their legs will bear witness to what they have done.
And if We wished, We would blot out their eyes and they will run to the path. But how will they be able to see?
And if We wished, We would transform them on the spot; then they will not know how to move forward or return.
To whomsoever We grant a long life, We bring down his form. Will they not understand?
We did not teach him (Muhammad) poetry; it doesn't suit him either. This is just a reminder and a clear reading [Qur'an].
so that he may warn the one who is alive and that the Word may be fulfilled against the disbelievers.
Do they not see that, among what Our hands have made, We have created for them cattle of which they are the owners;
and We have subjected them to them, some of them for horses and others for food;
and they derive other uses and drinks from it. Won't they be grateful?
And they adopted deities besides Allah, in the hope of being rescued...
The latter will not be able to help them, but will instead form an army against them.
Let not their words grieve you! We know what they are hiding and what they are disclosing.
Does not man see that We have created him from a drop of semen? And here he is [become] an open adversary!
He cites an example for Us, while he forgets his own creation; he says, "Who is going to give life to bones when they are reduced to dust?"
Say: "He who created them the first time will give them life again. He knows Himself perfectly in all creation.
it is He who made fire for you out of the green tree, and now you are lighting from it.
Will not He who created the heavens and the earth be able to create their like? Oh yes! and He is the great Creator, the All-Knowing.
When He wants a thing, His commandment is to say, "Be," and it is.
Praise therefore be to Him who holds the kingdom over all things in His hand. And to Him you will be drawn.
By those who are ranged in ranks.
By those who push (the clouds) with force.
By those who recite, as a reminder:
"Your God is indeed one,
the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of what exists between them and Lord of the Levants"
We decorated the sky closest to a setting: the stars,
in order to protect him against any rebellious devil.
They will not be able to listen to the supreme dignitaries [the Angels]; for they will be harassed on all sides,
and repressed. And they will have perpetual punishment.
Except the one who seizes some [information]; He is then chased by a piercing meteor.
Ask them if they are more difficult to create than those We have created? For We have created them of sticky mud!
But you are surprised, and they laugh!
And when they are reminded of it (the Qur'an), they do not remember;
and when they see a prodigy, they try to laugh at him,
and say, "This is just obvious magic.
When we are dead and become dust and bones, will we be resurrected?
as well as our first ancestors?"
Say: "Yes! and you will humble yourself."
There will be only one Cry, and behold, they will look,
and they will say, "Woe to us! it is the day of Retribution."
"It is the day of judgment that you called a lie."
"Gather the unrighteous and their wives and all that they worshipped,
apart from Allah. Then drive them to the Chemin de la Fournaise.
And stop them: for they must be interrogated."
"Why don't you help each other?"
But on that day, they will be completely submissive,
and some will turn to others questioning each other;
They will say: "It is you who forced us (to disbelieve)."
"It was rather you (the chiefs will say) who did not want to believe.
And we had no power over you. Rather, it was you who were transgressors.
The word of our Lord has therefore been fulfilled against us; Verily, we will taste [the punishment].
We have misled you, for in truth we ourselves were misled."
On that day, therefore, they will all be associated in the punishment.
This is how We treat criminals.
When it was said to them, "There is no god but Allah," they were puffed up with pride.
and said, "Are we going to abandon our gods for a mad poet?"
Rather, He came with the Truth and confirmed the (previous) Messengers.
You will certainly taste the painful punishment.
And you will be rewarded only according to what you worked,
except the chosen servants of Allah,
These will have a well-known reward:
fruits, and they will be honored,
in the Gardens of Delight,
on beds, face to face.
A cup of water filled with water should be circulated between them at a spring
white, tasty to drink,
It will not offend their reason or intoxicate them.
And they will have with them beauties with large eyes, with chaste eyes,
similar to the well-preserved white of the egg.
Then some will turn to each other, questioning each other.
One of them said: "I had a companion
who said, "Are you really one of those who believe?
Will we have to account when we die and are dust and bones?"
He'll say, "Would you look down from above?"
Then he will look down and see him right in the Furnace,
and will say: "By Allah! You almost caused my downfall!
and but for the blessing of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those who are dragged [to execution].
Is it not true that we shall not die
than for our first death and that we will not be punished?"
This, of course, is the great success.
It is for such a thing that those who open must open.
Is this better as a dwelling, or the tree of Zaqum?
We have assigned him to the trial of the unjust.
It is a tree that comes out of the bottom of the Furnace.
Its fruits are like devils' heads.
They must certainly eat it and they must fill their bellies with it.
Then they will have a mixture of boiling water on top.
Then their return will be to the Furnace.
It is because they found their ancestors in error,
and there they are running in their tracks.
Indeed, before them, most of the elders had lost their way.
And We had certainly sent warners among them.
Look at what has become of those who have been warned!
Except for the elect, among the servants of Allah:
Noah, in fact, called upon Us who are the Best Answering Machine.
And We saved him and his family from great anguish,
and We made his descendants the only survivors.
and We have perpetuated his memory in posterity,
Peace be upon Noah throughout the universe!
Thus do We reward the beneficents.
He was, indeed, one of Our believing servants.
Then We drowned the others.
Of his co-religionists, certainly, was Abraham.
When he came to his Lord with a sound heart.
When he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship?"
Are you looking for gods besides Allah in your error?
What do you think of the Lord of the universe?"
Then he cast a careful glance at the stars,
and says, "I'm sick."
They turned their backs on him and went away.
Then he crept up to their deities and said, "Don't you eat?
What do you have not to talk about?"
Then he began to strike them furtively with his right hand.
Then [the people] came running to him.
He said to them: "Do you worship what you yourselves carve,
when it is Allah who created you and what you make?"
They said, "Let them build him an oven and throw him into the furnace."
They wanted to play a trick on him; but it was they whom We put down.
And he said, "I'm going to my Lord and He'll guide me.
Lord, give me one of the righteous."
So we gave him the good news of a long-suffering boy (Ishmael).
Then when the latter was old enough to accompany him, [Abraham] said: "O my son, I see myself in a dream immolating you. So see what you think." (Ishmael) said: "O my dear father, do as you are commanded, and you will find me, Allah willing, among the enduring."
Then when both of them had submitted (to Allah's command) and he had thrown him on his forehead,
behold, We called him "Abraham!
You confirmed the vision. This is how We reward the beneficents."
This was certainly the manifest trial.
And We ransomed him with a generous immolation.
And We perpetuated his fame in posterity:
"Peace be upon Abraham."
Thus We reward the beneficent;
for he was one of Our believing servants.
We gave him the good news of Isaac as a prophet among the righteous.
And We blessed him and Isaac. Among their descendants there is the good man and the one who is manifestly unjust to himself.
And We did Moses and Aaron favor him,
And saved them and their people from great anguish,
and helped them, and they were the victors.
And We brought them the explicit book
and guided them to the right path.
And We perpetuated their fame in posterity:
"Peace be upon Moses and Aaron"
Thus We reward the beneficent;
for they were of the number of Our believing servants.
Elijah was indeed one of the Messengers.
When he said to his people, "Do you not fear [Allah]?"
Will you summon Ball (an idol) and leave the Best of Creators,
Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your oldest ancestors?"
They called him a liar. Well, they will be taken away (to punishment).
Except for the chosen servants of Allah.
And We perpetuated his fame in posterity:
"Peace be upon Elijah and his followers."
Thus do We reward the beneficent,
for he was one of Our believing servants.
And Lot, indeed, was one of the Messengers.
When We saved him and his whole family,
except for an old woman who was to disappear with the others,
And We destroyed the others
And you certainly pass by them in the morning
and at night. Are you not reasoning, then?
Jonah was certainly one of the Messengers.
When he flees to the packed boat,
He took part in the drawing of lots that designated him to be thrown [into the sea].
The fish swallowed him when he was blameworthy.
If he had not been among those who glorify Allah,
it would have remained in his womb until the day when one is resurrected.
We threw him on the bare ground, indisposed as he was.
And We caused a pumpkin plant to grow above him,
and then sent him (as a prophet) to a hundred thousand men or more.
They believed, and we gave them the enjoyment of life for a time.
So ask them, "Does your Lord have daughters and they sons?
Or have We created female angels, and are they witnesses of it?"
Certainly, they say in their lie:
"Allah has begotten" but they are certainly liars!
Would He have chosen daughters in preference to sons?
What have you to judge in this way?
Don't you think?
Or do you have an obvious argument?
Bring your Book if you are truthful!"
And they have established a kinship between Him and the jinn, while the jinn know that they [the disbelievers] are going to be taken away (for punishment).
Glory be to Allah. He is above what they describe!
Except for the chosen servants of Allah.
Verily, you and all that you worship,
will not be able to tempt [anyone],
except the one that will be burned in the Furnace.
There is not one of us who does not have a known place;
we are certainly the ranged in ranks;
and it is indeed we who celebrate the glory [of Allah].
Even if they said:
"If we had had a Recall of [our] ancestors,
we would have been the chosen servants of Allah!
They disbelieved in it and they will soon know.
For Our Word has already been given to Our servants, the Messengers,
that they are the ones who will be helped,
and that Our soldiers will have the upper hand.
Stay away from them until a while;
and watch them: they will soon see!
What! Is it Our chastisement that they seek to hasten?
When he falls into their place, it will be a bad morning for those who have been warned!
And depart from them until a while;
and observes; they will see soon!
Glory to your Lord, the Lord of power. He is above what they describe!
And peace be upon the Messengers,
and praise be to Allah, the Lord of the universe.
Sâd. By the Qur'an, with glorious fame (dikr)!
Those who have disbelieved are rather in pride and schism!
How many generations before them have We caused to perish, who cried out, alas, when there was no longer time to escape?
And they (the Meccans) were astonished that a warner among them had come to them, and the infidels say, "He is a magician and a great liar,
Will he reduce the gods to one God? This is a truly astonishing thing."
And their notables departed, saying, "Go away, and remain constant to your gods: this is really a desirable thing.
We did not hear this in the last religion (Christianity); it is in truth only pure invention!
What! Is it on him, among us, that the Reminder [the Qur'an] would have been sent down?" Rather, they are in doubt about My message. Or rather, they have not yet tasted My chastisement!
Or do they hold the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the Giver par excellence.
Or do they have the kingdom of heaven and earth and of what exists between them? Well, let them get there by any means!
An army of coalition members who, right here, will be routed!
Before them, the people of Noah, the Aad and Pharaoh the man of the pals (or the Pyramids),
and the Tamūd, the people of Lot, and the people of Al-Aykah, (have all denied their Messengers). Here are the coalitions.
There is not one of them who has not called the Messengers liars. Well, My punishment has proven against them!
They are waiting for only one Cry, without repetition.
And they say, "Lord, hasten our portion before the Day of Reckoning."
Endure what they say; and remember David, Our servant, endowed with strength [in worship] and full of repentance [to Allah].
We subdued the mountains to glorify Allah, night and morning, in his company,
and the birds gathered in a mass, all of them only obeying him [Allah].
And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and the faculty of judging rightly.
And did the news of the disputants come to you when they climbed the wall of the sanctuary?
When they came to David, he was frightened. They said, "Do not be afraid! We are both in dispute; one of us has wronged the other. Judge therefore justly between us, do not be unjust, and guide us to the right path.
This is my brother: he has ninety-nine sheep, while I have only one sheep. He told me: 'Entrust her to me' and in the conversation, he put a lot of pressure on me."
He [David] said, "He was certainly unjust to you in asking to join your sheep to his sheep." Many people transgress the rights of their associates, except those who believe and do good deeds, although they are very rare. And David thought then that We had put him to the test. So he asked his Lord for forgiveness and fell down prostrate and repented.
We forgave him. He will have a place close to Us and a beautiful refuge.
"O David, We have made you a caliph on earth. Judge therefore justly among the people and do not follow the passion, otherwise it will lead you astray from the path of Allah." For those who stray from the path of Allah will have a severe punishment for forgetting the Day of Reckoning.
We did not create heaven and earth and what exists between them in vain. This is what those who have disbelieved think. Woe to those who have disbelieved for the fire [that awaits them]!
Will We treat those who believe and do good deeds like those who make a mess on earth? Or will We treat the pious as the wicked?
A blessed Book which We have sent down to you, that they may meditate on its verses and that the endowed with understanding may reflect.
And to David We gave Solomon, what a good servant! - He was full of repentance.
When one afternoon he was presented with magnificent racehorses,
he said: "Yes, I have been so pleased to love the goods (of this world) that I have forgotten the remembrance of my Lord until [the sun] has hidden itself behind its veil.
Bring them back to me." Then he began to cut off their legs and necks.
And We had certainly tried Solomon by placing a body on his seat. Then he repented.
He said, "Lord, forgive me and give me a kingdom such as no one after me will have. You are the great Giver."
We then subjected him to the wind, which, by his order, blew moderately wherever he pleased.
As well as devils, builders and divers of all kinds.
And still others, coupled in chains.
"This is our gift; distribute it or withhold it without having to account for it."
And he has a place close to Us and a beautiful refuge.
And remember Job, Our servant, when he called upon his Lord, "The Devil has inflicted distress and suffering upon me."
Strike [the earth] with your foot: here is fresh water to wash you and here is something to drink.
And We restored to him his family and made them twice as numerous, as a mercy from Us and as a reminder to the understanding.
"And take a bundle of twigs in your hand, and strike with it. And do not violate your oath." Yes, We found him really enduring. What a good servant! He was constantly repenting.
And remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Our mighty and far-sighted servants.
We have made them the object of a special distinction: the reminder of the afterlife.
They are certainly among the best elected officials with Us.
And remember Ishmael and Elisha, and Dal Kifl, each of them among the best.
This is a reminder. It is to the pious that belongs, in truth, the best retreat,
The Gardens of Eden, open doors for them,
where, leaning on their elbows, they will ask for abundant fruit and drink.
And beside them will be the beautiful ones with chaste looks, all of the same age.
This is what is promised to you for the Day of Reckoning.
This will be Our inexhaustible allocation.
There you go! While the rebels will certainly have the worst retreat,
Hell where they will burn. And what a dreadful bed!
There you go! Let them taste it: boiling water and purulent water,
and other punishments of the same kind.
Here is a group that enters in a hurry at the same time as you, no welcome to them. They're going to burn in the Fire.
They said, "No welcome for you, rather. It is you who have prepared this for us." What a bad place to stay!
They said, "Lord, the one who prepared this for us, add to him a double punishment in the Fire."
And they said, "Why don't we see people whom we counted among the evildoers?
Have we mocked them (wrongly) or are they out of sight?"
Such are the quarrels of the people of the Fire.
Say: "I am only a warner. There is no god but Allah, the One, the Supreme Ruler,
Lord of heaven and earth and of what exists between them, the Mighty, the Great Forgiver."
Say: "This (the Qur'an) is great news,
but you turn away from it.
I had no knowledge of the sublime cohort at the time they were contesting.
It is only revealed to me that I am a clear warner."
When your Lord said to the Angels, "I am going to create a human being out of clay.
When I have formed him well and breathed into him with My Spirit, fall down before him in prostration."
Then all the angels fell down,
with the exception of Iblîs, who was puffed up with pride and was among the infidels.
(Allah) said to him: "O Iblis, who has prevented you from prostrating yourself before what I have created with My hands? Are you puffed up with pride or do you consider yourself among the highest?"
"I am better than he," says [Iblis,] "You created me of fire and you created him of clay."
(Allah) said: "Get out of here, you will be banished;
and upon you will be my curse until the day of retribution."
"Lord," says [Iblis], "give me a delay, until the day when they are resurrected."
(Allah) said: "You are one of those who are given a delay,
until the day of the Well-Known Moment."
"By Your power!" says [Satan]. I will certainly seduce them all,
except Your chosen servants from among them."
(Allah) said: "Verily, and this is the truth that I speak,
I will certainly fill Hell with you and all those of them who follow you."
Say: "For this I do not ask you for any wages; and I am not an impostor.
This [the Qur'an] is only a reminder to the universe.
And you'll certainly hear from them soon!"
The revelation of the Book comes from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.
We have sent down the Book to you in all truth. Worship Allah by worshipping Him exclusively.
Pure religion belongs to Allah. While those who take protectors apart from Him say: "We worship them only so that they may bring us closer to Allah." Verily, Allah will judge among them by what they differ from. Allah does not guide one who is a liar and a great ungrateful.
If Allah had wanted to give Himself a child, He would have chosen what He wanted from what He creates. Glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Supreme Ruler.
He created the heavens and the earth in all truth. He winds night over day and winds day over night, and He has made the sun and the moon each to pursue its course for a fixed term. He is indeed the Mighty, the Great Forgiver!
He created you from a single person and drew from her his wife. And He sent down eight pairs of cattle for you. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in three darknesses. This is Allah your Lord! To Him belongs all the Kingship. There is no divinity but Him. How can you turn away [from his worship]?
If you do not believe, Allah largely dispenses with you. Of His servants, however, He does not accept disbelief. And if you're grateful, He accepts it for you. No sinner will bear the sins of another. Then to your Lord will be your return: He will then inform you of what you were doing, for He knows perfectly well the contents of the breasts.
And when a misfortune befalls man, he calls upon his Lord, turning to Him. And when He bestows a favor on Him on His behalf, he forgets the reason for which he appealed, and he assigns equals to Allah, in order to lead (people) astray from His path. Say, "Enjoy your disbelief for a short time. You are one of the people of the Fire."
Does he who, in the hours of the night, remains in devotion, prostrate and standing, taking care of the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord... Say: "Are they equal, those who know and those who do not know?" Only those endowed with intelligence remember.
Say: "O My servants who have believed! Fear your Lord." Those who do good here will have a good [reward]. The land of Allah is vast and the enduring will have their full reward without counting.
Say: "I have been commanded to worship Allah by worshipping Him exclusively,
and I was commanded to be the first of the Muslims.
Say: "If I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a terrible day."
Say: "It is Allah whom I worship, and worship Him exclusively.
Worship therefore besides Him whomever you will!" - Say: "The losers are those who, on the Day of Resurrection, have caused the loss of their own souls and those of their families." This is the obvious loss.
Above them they will have layers of fire and layers below them. This is what Allah threatens His slaves with. "O My slaves, fear Me!"
And to those who depart from the Taghût so as not to worship them, while they return to Allah, to them the good news! Announce the good news to My servants
who give ear to the Word, and then follow the best that is in it. These are the ones whom Allah has guided, and they are the ones who are endowed with understanding.
Well, what! The one against whom the decree of punishment is revealed,... Do you save the one who is in the Fire?
But those who fear their Lord will have [for their dwelling] floors [in Paradise] above which other floors are built and under which rivers flow. Allah's promise! Allah does not fail in His promise.
Do you not see that Allah brings water down from heaven and then brings it to springs in the earth; then with this, He brings forth a crop of various colors, which then withers, so that you see it yellowed; then He smashes it to smithereens. This is certainly a reminder to the intelligent [people].
Is the one whose chest Allah opens to Islam and who thus holds a light from His Lord... Woe therefore to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah. These are obviously misguided.
Allah has sent down the most beautiful of narrations, a Book of which [some verses] are similar and repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shudder (to hear him); then their skins and hearts are appeased at the remembrance of Allah. This is Allah's guide by which He guides whomever He wills. But whoever Allah leads astray has no guide.
Is he who on the Day of Resurrection will have protected his face from the worst punishment... And the unrighteous will be told: "Taste what you have acquired."
Those who lived before them denied (the Messengers), the punishment came to them from where they did not foresee it.
Allah has given them a taste of ignominy in this life. The punishment of the afterlife, however, is greater, if only they knew!
In this Qur'an, we have cited examples of all kinds for people to remember.
A Qur'an [in Arabic], devoid of twists, so that they may be pious!
Allah has quoted as a parable a man belonging to associates quarrelling about him and a man belonging to one man: Are they equal in example? Praise be to Allah! But most of them don't know.
Verily thou shalt die, and they shall also die;
then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will argue with your Lord.
Who is more unrighteous than the one who lies against Allah and calls the truth a lie when it comes to him? Is it not in Hell that there is a refuge for the disbelievers?
Whereas the one who comes with the truth and the one who confirms it, these are the pious.
They will have everything they desire from their Lord; this is the reward of the beneficent,
so that Allah may erase the worst of their deeds and reward them according to the best they have done.
Is Allah not sufficient for His slave [as a support]? And they frighten you with what is outside of Him. And whoever Allah leads astray has no guide.
Whoever Allah guides, no one can lead astray. Is not Allah the Mighty and the Possessor of the power to punish?
If you were to ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" They would certainly say, "Allah." Say: "Do you see those whom you invoke besides Allah; If Allah wanted to harm me, could [these gods] dispel His evil? Or if He wanted mercy on me, could they withhold His mercy?" - Say: "Allah is sufficient for me: in Him those who seek support place their trust."
Say: "O my people, act according to your method, I will act [according to mine]. Soon you will know
on whom a punishment will fall that will degrade him; and on whom a lasting punishment will be justified."
We have sent down the Book to you for men in all truth. Whoever guides himself [does so] for his own good; and whoever goes astray, goes astray to his detriment. You are not responsible [for their own affairs].
Allah receives souls at the time of their death as well as those who do not die during their sleep. He retains those to whom He has decreed death, while He sends the others away until a fixed time. There is certainly evidence there for people who think.
Have they adopted intercessors besides Allah? Say: "What! Even if they have nothing and are devoid of reason?
Say: "The whole intercession belongs to Allah. To Him is the kingdom of heaven and earth. Then it is to Him that you will be brought back."
And when Allah is mentioned alone, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter tense and when those who are outside of Him are mentioned, they rejoice.
Say: "O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of all that the world does not know and what it perceives, it is You who will judge among Your servants what they differed about."
If the unrighteous possessed all that is on earth, and as much more, they would offer it as a ransom to escape the worst punishment on the Day of Resurrection; and there will appear to them from Allah what they never imagined;
and the misdeeds they have committed will appear to them, and what they mocked will envelop them.
When a misfortune befalls man, he invokes Us. When, afterwards, We grant him a favor from Us, he says: "I owe it only to [my] knowledge." It's a test, rather; But most of them don't know.
Thus spoke those who lived before them. But what they have acquired has been of no use to them;
They were therefore affected by the bad consequences of their gains. Those of these people [the Meccans] who have committed injustice will be affected by the evil consequences of their achievements, and they will not be able to oppose the power [of Allah].
Do they not know that Allah bestows His gifts generously or restricts them to whomever He wills? There is evidence in this for people who believe.
Say: "O My servants who have committed excesses to your own detriment, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. For Allah forgives all sins. Yes, He is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
And return repentant to your Lord, and submit to Him, before the punishment comes to you, and then you receive no help.
And follow the best revelation that has come down to you from your Lord, before the chastisement comes to you suddenly, without your sensing it;
before a soul says, "Woe to me for my sins against Allah. For I have certainly been among the scoffers."
or that she would say: "If Allah had guided me, I would certainly have been among the pious."
or else that she will say when she sees the punishment: "Ah! If there was a return for me! Then I would be among the beneficents."
"Oh yes! My verses came to you and you called them a lie, you were puffed up with pride and you were among the disbelievers."
And on the Day of Resurrection, you will see the faces of those who lied about Allah, darkened. Is it not in Hell that there will be a dwelling place for the proud?
And Allah will save those who have been pious by making them gain [their place in Paradise]. No evil will touch them, nor will they be afflicted.
Allah is the Creator of all things, and of all things He is the Guarantor.
He holds the keys of heaven and earth; and those who do not believe in the verses of Allah are the losers.
Say: "Will you command me to worship other than Allah, O ignorant ones?"
Indeed, it has been revealed to you and to those who have gone before you: "If you give partners to Allah, your work will certainly be in vain; and you will most certainly be among the losers.
On the contrary, worship Allah alone and be among the grateful."
They did not esteem Allah as He should be, whereas on the Day of Resurrection He will make the whole earth a handful, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand. Glory be to Him! He is above what they associate with Him.
And they will blow into the trumpet, and behold, those who are in the heavens and those who are on the earth will be struck by lightning, except those whom Allah will [spare]. Then they will blow again, and there they are, standing and watching.
And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord; the Book will be laid down and the prophets and witnesses will be called; they will be decided among them in all equity and they will not be wronged;
and each soul will be fully rewarded for what he has done. He [Allah] knows best what they are doing.
And those who had disbelieved will be led in groups to Hell. And when they get there, its gates will be opened, and its guardians will say to them, "Have not messengers come to you from among you, reciting to you the verses of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this day?" They will say: Yes, but the decree of punishment has proved to be right against the disbelievers.
"Enter," they will say, "through the gates of Hell, to dwell there forever." How bad is the place for the proud to dwell!
And those who had feared their Lord will be led in groups to Paradise. Then, when they get there and its doors open, its guardians will say to them: "Hail to you! you have been good: come in, therefore, to dwell there forever."
And they will say: "Praise be to Allah, who has kept His promise to us and made us inherit the earth! We will settle in Paradise wherever we want." How great is the reward of those who do good!
And you will see the angels circling around the throne, praising their Lord and glorifying Him. And he will be judged between them in all fairness, and it will be said: "Praise be to Allah, Lord of the universe."
H'â, Mîm.
The revelation of the Book comes from Allah, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.
The Forgiver of sins, the Acceptor of repentance, the Harsh One in punishment, the Bearer of favors. There is no divinity but Him and to Him is the destination.
Only those who have disbelieved discuss the verses of Allah. Let their activities in the country not deceive you.
Before them, Noah's people called (His Messenger) liars, and the coalition after them (did the same), and each community conceived the plan to seize His Messenger. And they discussed false arguments for rejecting the truth. So I grabbed them. And what a punishment was mine!
Thus the Word of your Lord proved to be right against those who disbelieved: "They shall be the people of the Fire."
Those (the Angels) who carry the Throne and those who surround it praise their Lord, believe in Him, and beg forgiveness for those who believe: "Lord! You extend Your mercy and knowledge to all things. So forgive those who repent and follow Your path and protect them from the punishment of Hell.
Lord! Bring them into the gardens of Eden which You have promised them, and the righteous among their forefathers, wives, and descendants, for You are the Mighty, the Wise.
And preserve them [from the punishment] of evil deeds. Whoever You save from evil deeds on that day, You will have mercy on him." And this is the enormous success.
To those who do not believe, it will be proclaimed: "Allah's aversion [to you] is greater than your aversion to yourselves when you were called to faith and persisted in disbelief."
They will say, "Our Lord, You have put us to death twice and given us life twice, so we acknowledge our sins. Is there a way out of it?"
«... This is because when Allah was invoked alone, you did not believe; and if you gave Him associates, then you believed. Judgment belongs to Allah, the Most High, the Most Great."
It is He who makes you see His proofs, and brings down from heaven a sustenance for you. Only the one who returns [to Allah] remembers.
Invoke Allah, therefore, by worshipping Him exclusively, no matter how much the disbelievers may be repulsed by it.
He is the One who is exalted to the highest degrees, the Possessor of the Throne, He sends the Spirit by His command upon whomever He wills among His servants, so that he may warn of the Day of Meeting,
the day when they will appear without anything in them being hidden from Allah. To whom does royalty belong today? To Allah, the One, the Dominator.
On that day, each soul will be rewarded according to what it has acquired. On that day, there is no injustice, for Allah is swift in [His] accounts.
And warn them of the day that is approaching, when hearts will rise to the throats, terrified (or anguished). The unjust will have neither a zealous friend nor an intercessor who is listened to.
He (Allah) knows the betrayal of the eyes, just like what the breasts hide.
And Allah judges justly, while those whom they invoke besides Him judge nothing. Verily, it is Allah who is the Hearer, the Clairvoyant.
Do they not go about the earth to see what has become of those who have lived before them? They were stronger than they were and left many more remnants on earth. Allah took them for their sins, and they had no protector against Allah.
This was so, because their Messengers had brought them the proofs, but they showed themselves to be disbelievers. So Allah seizes them, for He is strong and dreadful in His punishment.
We did send Moses with Our signs and clear proof,
to Pharaoh, Haman and Korah. But they said, "Magician! Great liar!"
Then when he had brought them the truth from Us, they said, "Kill the sons of those who have believed with him, and let their wives live." And the tricks of the disbelievers are nothing but waste.
And Pharaoh said, "Let me kill Moses. And let him call his Lord! I fear that he will change your religion or that he will bring corruption to the earth."
Moses said to him, "I seek protection from my Lord and yours from every proud one who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning."
And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who was concealing his faith, said, "Do you kill a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah?' Whereas he came to you with the clear proofs from your Lord. If he is a liar, his lie will be to his detriment; whereas if it is truthful, then part of what it threatens you with will fall on you." Verily, Allah does not guide the one who is outrageous and impostor.
"O my people, triumphant on earth, you have the kingdom today. But who will help us from the severity of Allah if it comes to us?" Pharaoh said, "I tell you only what I consider good. I guide you only to the path of righteousness."
And he who was a believer said, "O my people, I fear for you a day like that of the coalition.
A fate similar to that of the people of Noah, the 'Aad and the Thamûd and those [who lived] after them." Allah does not want to do injustice to the servants.
"O my people, I fear for you the day of the Mutual Call,
The Day when you turn your back in rout, without there being a protector for you against Allah." And whoever Allah leads astray, has no guide.
True, Joseph came to you before with the clear evidence, but you never ceased to have doubts about what he had brought you. But when he died, then you say: "Allah will never send a Messenger after him again." Thus Allah leads astray the one who is outrageous and the one who doubts.
Those who dispute the wonders of Allah without any proof having come to them, [their deed] is greatly hateful to Allah and to those who believe. Thus Allah seals the heart of every proud tyrant.
And Pharaoh said, "O Haman, build me a tower, and perhaps I may reach the ways,
the ways of heaven, and I shall perceive the God of Moses; but I think this one is a liar." Thus Pharaoh's evil deed seemed to him to be embellished; and he was led astray; and Pharaoh's stratagem is doomed only to destruction.
And the one who had believed said, "O my people, follow me. I will guide you to the path of righteousness.
O my people, this life is only temporary enjoyment, while the hereafter is truly the abode of stability.
Whoever does a bad deed will be rewarded only by his peer; and whoever, male or female, does a good deed while being a believer, then they will enter Paradise to receive their sustenance without reckoning.
O my people, but what have I to call you to salvation, when you call me to the Fire?
You invite me to deny Allah and to give Him partners of whom I have no knowledge, while I call you to the Almighty, to the Great Forgiver.
There is no doubt that what you are calling me to cannot answer an invocation either here on earth or in the Hereafter. It is to Allah that we have returned, and the outrageous are the people of the Fire.
Soon you will remember what I am telling you; and I entrust my fate to Allah. Verily, Allah is Clairvoyant over the servants.
So Allah protected him from the misdeeds of their tricks, while the worst punishment surrounded Pharaoh's people:
Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening. And on the Day when the Hour shall come (it shall be said), "Bring Pharaoh's people into the severest punishment."
And when they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will say to those who were puffed up with pride, "We followed you: could you save us from any part of the fire?"
And those who were puffed up with pride will say: "Verily, here we are." Allah has already given judgment among the servants.
And those who are in the Fire will say to the guardians of Hell, "Pray to your Lord to lighten us one day from [our] torment."
They will say, "Did not your Messengers bring you clear proofs?" They will say, "Yes"! They [the guards] will say, "Well, pray!" And the supplication of the disbelievers is an aberration.
Verily, We will help Our Messengers and those who believe, in this life as well as in the Day when the witnesses [the Guardian Angels] stand (the Day of Judgment),
on the day when their excuse will not be of use to the unjust, while there will be a curse and a worse abode for them.
For We have brought guidance to Moses, and caused the Children of Israel to inherit the Book,
a guide and a reminder to people endowed with intelligence.
Endure then, for Allah's promise is truth, beg forgiveness for your sin, and praise the glory and praise of your Lord, night and morning.
Those who argue about the verses of Allah without any proof having come to them, have nothing but pride in their breasts. They will not achieve their goal. Therefore implore the protection of Allah, for He is the Hearer, the Clairvoyant.
The creation of the heavens and the earth is something greater than the creation of people. But most people don't know.
The blind and the sighted are not equal, and those who believe and do good works cannot be compared to the one who does evil. It's rare that you remember!
Truly; The Hour is about to arrive: there is no doubt about it; But most people don't believe it.
And your Lord said, "Call Me, and I'll answer you. Those who, out of pride, refuse to worship Me will soon enter Hell, humiliated."
Allah is the One who has assigned you the night to rest, and the day to see clearly. Allah is the Bravier of grace to men, but most people are not grateful.
This is your Lord, the Creator of all things. There is no divinity but Him. How is it that you turn away (from the straight path)?
So those who deny the wonders of Allah turn away [from the straight path.]
It is Allah who has assigned you the earth as a stable dwelling place and the sky as your roof and has given you your form, - and what a beautiful form He has given you! - and He has nourished you with good things. This is Allah your Lord; Glory be to Allah, Lord of the universe!
He is the Living One. There is no divinity but Him. Call Him, then, by devoting an exclusive worship to Him. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the universe!
Say: "It was forbidden for me, once the proofs came to me from my Lord, to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah, and I was commanded to submit to the Lord of the universe."
It is He who created you from the earth, then from a drop of semen, then from an adhesion; Then He brings you out as a little child so that you may reach maturity and then become old, some of you die sooner, and so that you may reach a fixed time, so that you may reason.
It is He who gives life and gives death. Then when He decides a matter, He has only to say, "Be," and it is.
Have you not seen how those who argue about the verses of Allah allow themselves to be turned astray?
Those who call the Book (the Qur'an) and that with which We sent Our Messengers lies; they will soon know,
when, from the shackles around their necks and with chains, they will be dragged
in boiling water; and then they will burn in the Fire.
Then they will be told: "Where are those whom you associate
To Allah?" "They have moved away from us," they will say. Or rather, we didn't invoke anything before." Thus Allah leads the disbelievers astray.
This is the price of your exultation on earth, for no reason, as well as of your immoderate joy.
Walk through the gates of Hell to dwell there forever. How bad is the place for the proud to dwell!
Endure then. Allah's promise is true. Whether We show you some of what We threaten them with or whether We put you to death (before that)... to Us they will be brought back.
Verily, We have sent Messengers before you. There are some of whom We have told you the story; and there are some of whom We have not told you the story. And it is not proper for a Messenger to bring a sign [or verse] except with the permission of Allah. When Allah's command comes, everything will be decided in all justice; and those who tell lies are then the losers.
It is Allah who has made you cattle to ride and eat from them,
and you have profits there, and that you may attain to them a necessary thing that was dear to your heart. It is on them and on the ships that you are transported.
And He shows you His wonders. What wonders of Allah do you deny?
Do they not then travel the earth to see what has become of those who were before them? They were more numerous than they were and much more powerful, and they had left many more remnants on earth. But what they have acquired has been of no use to them.
When their Messengers brought them the clear proofs, they exulted in the knowledge they had. And what they mocked enveloped them.
Then, when they saw Our strictness, they said: "We believe in Allah alone, and we deny what we give Him as partners."
But their belief, at the moment when they had ascertained Our rigor, did not profit them; This is Allah's rule towards His servants in the past. And it was there that the disbelievers found themselves the losers.
H'â, Mîm.
[It is] a Revelation from the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
A Book whose verses are detailed (and clearly stated), an Arabic Qur'an for people who know,
herald and warner. But most of them turn away; it is because they do not hear.
And they said, "Our hearts are veiled against what you call us to, our ears are deaf. And between us and you, there is a partition. Act therefore on your side; we act with our own."
Say: "I am just a man like you. It has been revealed to me that your God is one God. Seek the right path to Him and beg His forgiveness." And woe to the Associators
who do not pay Zakat and do not believe in the Hereafter!
Those who believe and do good works will have a huge reward that will never be interrupted.
Say: "Will you deny [the existence] of Him who created the earth in two days and give Him equals? Such is the Lord of the universe,
it is He who has fixed mountains above her, blessed her and assigned her his food resources in four days of equal duration. [This is the answer] to those who ask you.
He then spoke to heaven, which was then smoked, and said to it and to the earth, "Come, both of you, willingly or unwillingly." Both said, "We come obediently."
He decreed to make seven heavens in two days and revealed to each heaven its function. And We have decorated the nearest heaven with lamps [stars] and have protected it. This is the Order established by the Mighty, the All-Knowing.
If they turn away from it, then tell them; "I warned you of a thunderbolt like that which struck the 'Aad and the Tamûd."
When the Messengers came to them from before them and from behind, "Worship only Allah," they said, "If our Lord had willed, He would certainly have sent down angels. So we don't believe [the message] with which you were sent."
As for the 'Aad, they were unjustly puffed up with pride on earth and said, "Who is stronger than us?" What! Have they not seen that in truth Allah who created them is stronger than they? And they denied Our signs.
We unleashed against them a violent and icy wind in evil days, in order to make them taste the punishment of ignominy in this life. The punishment of the Hereafter, however, is still more ignominious, and they will not be helped.
And as for the Tamûd, We guided them; but they preferred blindness to guidance. It was then that they were seized by the lightning of the most humiliating torture for what they had acquired.
And We saved those who believed and feared Allah.
And on the Day when the enemies of Allah will be gathered en masse to the Fire... Then they will be pushed [in his direction].
Then, when they are there, their hearing, their eyes, and their skins will testify against them for what they were doing.
They will say to their skins, "Why did you testify against us?" They will say: "It is Allah who has made us speak, He who makes all things speak. It is He who created you for the first time and it is to Him that you will have returned."
You could not hide yourself so much that neither your hearing, nor your eyes, nor your skins could testify against you. But you thought that Allah didn't know much about what you were doing.
And it was this thought that you had of your Lord that ruined you, so that you became among the losers.
If they endure, the Fire will be their dwelling place; and if they seek to apologize, they will not be excused.
And We have appointed for them companions who are inseparable [from the demons] who have embellished for them what was before and behind them. And the decree proved to be just against them, as it was against the other communities of jinn and men who lived before them. They are certainly losers!
And those who disbelieved said: "Do not listen to this Qur'an, and make a ruckus (during its recitation), so that you have the upper hand."
We will certainly make those who do not believe a severe punishment taste, and will certainly reward them [with a punishment] worse than their misdeeds.
Thus, the reward of the enemies of Allah will be the Fire where they will have an eternal abode, as a punishment for denying Our verses [the Qur'an].
And the disbelievers will say: "Lord, let us see those of the jinn and of the men who have led us astray, so that we may place them all under our feet, so that they may be among the lowest."
Those who say, "Our Lord is Allah," and stand in the right way, the angels descend upon them. "Do not be afraid or grieved; but have the good news of the Paradise that was promised to you.
We are your protectors in this life and in the hereafter; and you will have what your souls desire and what you ask for,
a place of welcome from a Most Great Forgiver, a Most Merciful".
And who speaks more beautiful words than the one who calls to Allah, does good deeds, and says: "I am one of the Muslims?"
Good deeds and bad deeds are not the same. Repel (evil) by what is better; and now the one with whom you had animosity becomes like a warm friend.
But (this privilege) is given only to those who endure, and it is given only to the possessor of infinite grace.
And if the Devil ever urges you (to do otherwise), then seek refuge with Allah; it is He, truly the Hearer, the All-Knowing.
Among His wonders are night and day, the sun and the moon: do not bow down to the sun or the moon, but bow down to Allah who created them, if it is Him whom you worship.
But if they puff themselves up with pride... those who are with your Lord [the angels] glorify Him, night and day, never weary!
And among His wonders is that you see the humbled earth. Then as soon as We bring the water down on it, it rises and increases. The One who gives it life is certainly the One who will revive the dead, for He is Omnipotent.
Those who distort the meaning of Our verses (the Qur'an) do not escape Us. Will he who is thrown into the Fire be better than the one who comes safely on the Day of Resurrection? Do what you want because He is Clairvoyant about everything you do;
Those who do not believe in the Remembrance [the Qur'an] when it comes to them... whereas it is a powerful [unassailable] Book;
The false does not reach him [on any side], either from before or from behind: it is a revelation emanating from a Sage, worthy of praise.
You are told only what was said to the Messengers before you. Your Lord is certainly the Holder of forgiveness and also the Holder of a painful punishment.
If We had made it a Qur'an in a language other than Arabic, they would have said: "Why have its verses not been made clear? what? A non-Arab [Qur'an] and an Arab [Messenger]?" Say: "For those who believe, he is a guide and a healing." And as for those who do not believe, there is deafness in their ears, and they are struck with blindness as far as it is concerned; these are called from a distant place.
We did give Moses the Book. Then there was controversy about it. And if it were not for a previous word of your Lord, they would certainly have been decided. They are really in a troubling state of doubt about him.
Whoever does a good deed, it is for his own good. And whoever does evil, he does it at his own expense. Your Lord, however, is not unjust to servants.
To Him belongs the knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of its husk, no female conceives or gives birth without His knowledge. And the day He calls them, "Where are My associates?" they'll say, "We declare to You that there is no witness among us."
And what they invoked before will forsake them; and they will realize that they have no escape.
Man never tires of imploring good. If the disease touches him, he is desperate, helpless.
And if we make him taste mercy from Us, after distress has befallen him, he will certainly say, "It is due to me! And I don't think the Hour will rise [one day]. And if I am brought back to my Lord, I will find the most beautiful part near Him." We will inform those who have disbelieved of what they have done, and We will surely give them a taste of severe punishment.
When We shower man with blessings, he slips away and goes away. And when a misfortune befalls him, he then gives himself up to a long prayer.
Say: "See? If this (the Qur'an) emanates from Allah and then you deny it; who will find himself more misguided than he who distances himself in dissent?"
We will show them Our signs in the universe and in themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this (the Qur'an) is the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is a witness of all things?
They are in doubt, are they not, about meeting their Lord? It is indeed He who embraces all things (through His knowledge and power).
H'â, Mîm.
Aîn, Sîn, Qâf.
This is how Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, makes revelations to you, as to those who lived before you.
To Him belongs what is in heaven and what is on earth. And He is the Sublime, the Most Great,
The heavens are very close to splitting from their summits when the angels glorify their Lord, praise Him and beg forgiveness for those on earth. Verily, Allah is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
And as for those who take protectors apart from Him, Allah sees to it what they do. And you are not a guarantor for them.
And so We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur'an, so that you may warn the Mother of Cities (Makkah) and its surroundings and warn of the Day of Gathering, about which there is no doubt, a group in Paradise and a group in the fiery furnace.
And if Allah had willed, He would have made it one community. But He brings whomever He wants into His mercy. And the unrighteous will have neither master nor helper.
Have they taken masters besides Him? It is Allah who is the only Master and it is He who gives life to the dead; and it is He who is Omnipotent.
On all your differences, the judgment belongs to Allah. This is Allah my Lord; in Him I place my trust and it is to Him that I return [repentant]
... Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has given you wives of yourselves, and cattle in pairs; by this means He multiplies you. There's nothing like Him; and He is the Hearer, the Clairvoyant.
He possesses the keys of the heavens and the earth. He allocates His gifts generously, or restricts them to whomever He wills. Verily, He is Omniscient.
He has legislated for you in matters of religion, what He enjoined Noah, what We revealed to you, as well as what We enjoined Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: "Establish religion; and don't make it a divisive issue." What you call the associators to do seems enormous to them: Allah elects and brings to Him whomever He wills and guides to Him the one who repents.
They were divided only after they had received knowledge, and this was done through rivalry among themselves. And if it were not for a previous word of your Lord for a fixed term, they would certainly have been decided. Those to whom the Book was given as an inheritance after them are really about it, in troubling doubt.
So call (people) to this; Stand upright as you have been commanded; do not follow their passions; and said, "I believe in all that Allah has sent down as the Book, and I have been commanded to be fair among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. Ours are our works and your works are yours. No argument [can decide] between us and you. Allah will bring us all together. And to Him is the destination."
And those who argue about Allah, after [His call] has been answered, their argument is worthless before Allah. Wrath will fall upon them, and they will have a severe punishment.
It is Allah who has sent down the Book in all truth, as well as the scales. And what do you know about it? Maybe the Hour is near?
Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it; while those who believe in it are fearful and know that it is the pure truth. And those who argue about the Hour are in a distant error.
Allah is gentle with His servants. He assigns [His possessions] to whomever He wills. And He is the Strong, the Mighty.
Whoever desires to plough [the field] of the Hereafter, We will increase his ploughing for him. Whoever desires to plough [the field] of this life, We will grant him [his enjoyments]; but he will have no part in the Hereafter.
Or would they have associates [with Allah] who would have established religious laws for them that Allah has never permitted? However, if the decisive judgment had not been pronounced, it would have been decided between them. The unrighteous will certainly have a painful punishment.
You will see the unrighteous terrified by what they have done, and the punishment will come upon them (inevitably). And those who believe and do good deeds will be in the flowery sites of the gardens, having what they will with their Lord. Such is the great grace!
This is the [good news] that Allah proclaims to those of His servants who believe and do good deeds. Say: "I do not ask you for any reward except affection for kinship." And whoever does a good deed, We respond with a still greater [reward]. Allah is indeed Forgiving and Grateful.
Or they say, he has invented a lie against Allah. Now, if Allah wills, He will seal your heart. By His words, however, Allah erases the false and confirms the true. He knows the contents of the breasts perfectly.
And it is He who accepts repentance from His servants, forgives wrongdoings, and knows what you do,
and grant [the wishes] of those who believe and do good deeds and increase His favor to them, while the disbelievers have a severe punishment.
If Allah were to bestow His gifts generously on [all] His servants, they would commit abuses on earth; but He sends down with measure what He wills. He knows His servants perfectly and is a Clairvoyant.
And it is He who brings down the rain after we have despaired of it, and pours out His mercy. And He is the Master, the One Worthy of praise.
Among His proofs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living things He has scattered there. He also has the power to bring them together whenever He wills.
Any misfortune that befalls you is due to what your hands have acquired. And He forgives much.
You cannot escape the power of Allah on earth; and you have no master or defender besides Allah.
And among His proofs are the ships across the sea, like mountains.
If He wills, He calms the wind, and there they are, standing still on its surface. These are certainly proofs for every enduring and grateful [man].
Or He destroys them as a punishment for what they have acquired. However, He forgives many.
Those who argue about Our evidence know well that they have no escape.
All that has been given to you is only the enjoyment of this present life; but that which is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who have believed and put their trust in their Lord,
who avoid the most grievous sins and sinfulness, and who forgive after becoming angry,
who respond to the call of their Lord, perform Salah, consult with one another about their affairs, spend what We assign to them,
and who, struck by injustice, retaliate.
The punishment for an evil deed is an identical evil action. But whoever forgives and reforms, his reward belongs to Allah. He does not love the unjust!
As for those who retaliate after being wronged, ... the latter have no way (legal recourse) against them;
There is no remedy except against those who harm people and commit abuses, contrary to the law, on earth: these will have a painful punishment.
And he who endures and forgives, this in truth, is part of the good disposition and resolution in affairs.
And whoever Allah leads astray has no protector after Him. However, when you see the punishment, you will see the unrighteous say, "Is there a way to return [to earth]?"
And you will see them exposed before Hell, confounded in degradation, and looking with a furtive eye, while those who have believed will say: "The losers are certainly those who on the Day of Resurrection are their own destruction and that of their families." The unrighteous will certainly suffer permanent punishment.
They will have no protector but Allah to help them, and whoever Allah leads astray has no way.
Respond to the call of your Lord before the day comes, the end of which Allah will never postpone. On that day there is no refuge for you, and you will not be able to deny (your sins).
If they turn away, ... We have not sent you to safeguard them, but you are only responsible for transmitting [the message]. And when We make man taste a mercy from Us, he rejoices; but if a misfortune befalls them for what their hands have perpetrated..., then the man is very ungrateful!
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wants. He gives girls to whom He wills, and gives boys to whom He wills,
or else He gives both boys and girls; and He makes whomever He wills barren. He is certainly Omniscient and Omnipotent.
It has not been given to a mortal that Allah speaks to him otherwise than by revelation or from behind a veil, or that He sends a messenger (Angel) who reveals, by His permission, what He [Allah] wants. He is Sublime and Wise.
And so We have revealed to you a spirit [the Qur'an] from Our order. You had no knowledge of the Book or of faith; but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will among Our servants. And verily thou guides to a straight path,
the way of Allah to Whoever belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. Yes, it is to Allah that all things are directed.
H'â, Mîm.
By the Explicit Book!
We have made it an Arabic Qur'an so that you can reason.
He is with Us, in the Mother Scripture (the original in heaven), sublime and full of wisdom.
What! Are We going to exempt you from the Remembrance [the Qur'an] because you are outrageous people?
How many prophets did We send to the ancients!
and not a prophet came to them that they did not deride him.
We have destroyed those more formidable than they! And we have already cited the example of the elders.
What if you ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" They will most certainly say, "The Mighty, the All-Knowing, created them."
He who gave you the earth for a cradle and made paths for you to be guided by;
He who brought down the water from heaven in measure, and with whom We revive a dead city. In this way you will be resurrected;
He who created the couples in their totality and made for you, ships and cattle, mounts,
so that you would sit on their backs, and then, after you had sat down on them, remember the blessing of your Lord and say, "Glory to Him who subjected all these things to us when we were not able to dominate them.
It is to our Lord that we will return."
And they made His servants a part of Him. The man is really an avowed ungrateful!
Or has He appointed Himself daughters from among what He creates and bestowed upon you sons in preference?
Now, when one of them is told of the birth of a similar one that he attributes to the Most Merciful, his face is darkened with deep sorrow.
What! This being (the girl) brought up in the midst of finery and who, in the dispute, is unable to defend herself by a clear and convincing argument?
And they made angels who are the servants of the Most Merciful feminine [beings]! Were they witnesses of their creation? Their testimony will then be recorded; and they will be questioned.
And they said, "If the Most Merciful had willed, we would not have worshiped them." They have no knowledge of it; they are only indulging in conjecture.
Or did We give them [the Qur'an] a Book before it that they would hold fast to?
But rather they said, "We found our ancestors on a religion, and we guide ourselves in their footsteps."
And so We have not sent a warner to a city before you, without its well-to-do people saying, "We have found our ancestors on a religion, and we are following in their footsteps."
He says, "Even if I come to you with a better direction than you found your ancestors on?" They said, "We do not believe the message with which you were sent."
We took revenge on them. Look at what happened to those who cried lies.
And when Abraham said to his father and his people, "I utterly disavow what you worship,
except the One who created me, for it is He who will guide me."
And he made it a word that was to be perpetuated among his descendants. Maybe they will come back?
But to these people and to their ancestors I have granted enjoyment until the Truth (the Qur'an) and an explicit Messenger came to them.
And when the Truth came to them, they said, "This is magic and we don't believe in it."
And they said, "Why was this Qur'an not sent down to a high person of one of the two cities?" (Mecca and Ta'if).
Are they the ones who distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have divided their sustenance among them in this life, and have raised them in rank one over the other, so that some may take others into their service. The mercy of your Lord is better, however, than what they gather.
If men were not to constitute a single (disbeliever) community, We would certainly have provided the houses of those who do not believe in the Most Merciful with silver roofs with stairs to ascend to them;
(We would have provided) their houses with doors and couches where they would lean their elbows,
as well as ornaments. And all this would be only a temporary enjoyment of the life of this world, while the hereafter, with your Lord, is for the pious.
And whoever blinds himself (and departs from) the remembrance of the Most Merciful, We point out to him a devil who becomes his inseparable companion.
They [the devils] are indeed turning [men] astray, while they think they are rightly guided.
When this [man] comes to Us, he will say [to his demon]: "Alas! Would that there is not between you and me the distance between the two easts [East and West]" - What a bad companion [that you are]!
It will not profit you on that day, since you have been unjust, that you are partners in the punishment.
Is it then you who make the deaf hear, or who guide the blind and those who are obviously misguided?
Either We take you away and then We will take revenge on them;
or that We will show you what We have promised them; for We have power over them.
Hold fast to what has been revealed to you because you are on the right path.
It is certainly a reminder [the Qur'an] for you and your people. And you will be questioned about it.
And ask those of Our messengers whom We have sent before you, whether We have instituted any gods besides the Most Merciful to worship?
We did indeed send Moses with Our miracles to Pharaoh and his notables. He says, "I am the Messenger of the Lord of the universe."
Then, when he came to them with Our miracles, behold, they laughed at it.
Every miracle that We showed them was more convincing than his previous one. And We seized them with chastisement, perhaps they will return [to Us].
And they said, "O magician! Implore your Lord for us in the name of the commitment He has made to you. We will follow the right path."
And when We had removed the punishment from them, behold, they violated their engagements.
And Pharaoh made a proclamation to his people and said, "O my people! Is not the kingdom of Misr [Egypt] mine and the canals that flow at my feet? Do you not observe?
Am I not better than this wretch who can hardly express himself?
Why weren't gold bracelets thrown at him? Why didn't the angels go with him?"
Thus he sought to stun his people and so they obeyed him, for they were perverse people.
Then when they had angered Us, We took revenge on them and drowned them all.
We made them an antecedent and an example [a lesson] for posterity.
When the example of the son of Mary is cited, your people turn away from it,
saying, "Are our gods better, or he?" It is only in polemic terms that they cite him as an example. They are more quarrelsome.
He (Jesus) was only a Servant whom We had showered with blessings and whom We had pointed out as an example to the Children of Israel.
If We wished, We would make you Angels who would succeed you on earth.
It will be a sign about the Hour. Do not doubt it. And follow me: this is a straight path.
May the Devil not turn you away! For he is an open enemy to you.
And when Jesus brought the proofs, he said, "I have come to you with wisdom and to explain to you some of your points of disagreement. Fear Allah, therefore, and obey me.
Verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. Worship Him, then. This is a straight path."
But the factions differed among themselves. Woe then to the unjust for the punishment of a painful day!
Are they just waiting for the Hour to come to them unexpectedly, without them realizing it?
Friends on that day will be enemies to one another; except the stakes.
"O My servants! You need have no fear today; you will not be afflicted,
Those who believe in Our signs and are Muslims,
"Enter Paradise, you and your wives, you will be feted there."
Gold dishes and cups will be circulated among them; and there will be [for them] all that souls desire and that which gladdens the eyes;" - and you will dwell there forever.
This is the Paradise that is made to inherit for what you did.
There will be many fruits for you to eat."
As for criminals, they will remain eternally in the punishment of Hell,
which will never be interrupted for them and where they will be in despair.
We did them no wrong, but they were the unrighteous.
and they will cry out, "O Malik! May your Lord finish us off!" He will say, "Verily, you are to dwell in it [forever]!"
"Verily, We brought you the Truth; but most of you hated the Truth."
Did they make any decision [among themselves]? Because it is We who decide!
Or do they expect that We will not hear their secrecy or their deliberations? Yes, you are! Our Angels take note of them.
Say: "If the Most Merciful had a child, then I would be the first to worship him."
Glory be to the Lord of heaven and earth, Lord of the Throne; It transcends what they describe.
Let them, therefore, sink into their falsehood and enjoy themselves until they meet the day that is promised to them.
He is God in heaven and God on earth; and He is the Wise, the All-Knowing!
And blessed be He to whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and of what is between them. He holds the science of the Hour. And to Him you will be drawn.
And those whom they invoke apart from Him have no power of intercession, except those who have testified to the truth in full knowledge of the facts.
And if you ask them who created them, they will most certainly say, "Allah." How is it then that they turn away?
And his word (the Prophet's word to Allah): "Lord, these are people who do not believe."
Well, depart from them (forgive them); and say, "Hello!" Because they will know soon.
H'â, Mîm.
By the Book (the Qur'an) explicit.
We sent him down on a blessed night, We are verily the One who warns,
during which every wise order is decided,
this is a commandment from Us. It is We who send [the Messengers],
for mercy from your Lord, for He is the Hearer, the All-Knowing,
Lord of heaven and earth and of what is between them, if only you could be convinced of it.
There is no divinity but Him. He gives life and gives death, and He is your Lord and the Lord of your first ancestors.
But these people, when in doubt, are having fun.
Well, wait for the day when the sky will bring visible smoke
that will cover people. It will be a painful punishment.
"Lord, remove punishment from us. For [now] we believe."
Where does this awareness come from when an explicit Messenger has already come to them,
Then they turned away from him, saying, "He is a man who has been instructed [by others], a man possessed."
We will dispel the punishment for a short time; for you will reoffend.
The day when We will use the greatest violence and take revenge.
And before them We have already tried Pharaoh's people, when a noble Messenger came to them,
[telling them]: "Hand over to me the servants of Allah! I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.
Do not be haughty about Allah, for I am giving you clear proof.
And I seek protection from my Lord and your Lord, that you may not stone me.
If you do not want to believe in me, stay away from me."
He then called upon his Lord: "They are criminal people."
"Journey by night with My servants; you will be prosecuted.
Leave the sea calm; [as you have crossed it] they are armies [doomed] to drowning."
How many gardens and springs they left [behind]
what fields and superb residences,
what delights in which they rejoiced.
And so it was and We caused another people to inherit it.
Neither heaven nor earth wept for them, and they had no delay.
And verily, We saved the Children of Israel from the degrading punishment
of Pharaoh who was haughty and outrageous.
We chose them wisely from among all the peoples of the universe,
and brought them miracles to put them to the test.
These (the Meccans) say:
"There is only one death for us, the first. And we will not be resurrected.
So bring back our ancestors, if you are truthful."
Are they the best or the people of Tubba' and those who came before them? We put them to death because they were really criminals.
It is not for entertainment that We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them.
We have created them only in all truth. But most of them don't know.
Verily, the Day of Decision will be the rendezvous of all of them,
the day when an ally will be of no use to [another] ally; and neither will they be helped,
except the one to whom Allah will have mercy. For it is He, the Mighty, the Most Merciful.
Certainly the tree of Zakkûm
will be the food of the great sinner.
Like molten metal; it will bubble in the bellies
like the bubbling of superheated water.
Let him be seized and carried right into the furnace;
then let boiling water be poured over his head as a punishment.
Taste! You [who claimed to be] the mighty, the noble.
That is what you doubted.
The stakes will be in a safe dwelling,
among gardens and springs,
They will wear satin and brocade garments and will be placed facing each other.
That's the way it is! And We will give them large-eyed houris for wives.
They will ask for all kinds of fruit in peace.
They will not taste death except their first death. And [Allah] will protect them from the punishment of the Furnace,
this is a grace of your Lord. And this is the enormous success.
We have only made it easy in your language, so that they may remember!
Wait, then. They too are waiting.
H'â, Mîm.
The revelation of the Book emanates from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.
Verily, there are proofs in the heavens and on earth for believers.
And in your own creation, and in what He scatters as animals, there are signs for people who believe with certainty.
Similarly, in the alternation of night and day, and in what Allah sends down from heaven as a sustenance [rain] by which He restores life to the earth when it is dead, and in the distribution of the winds, there are signs for people who reason.
These are the verses of Allah that We recite to you in all truth. Then in what word will they believe after [the word] of Allah and after His signs?
Woe to every great sinful impostor!
He hears the verses of Allah that are recited to him and then persists in his pride, as if he had never heard them. Tell him, therefore, a painful punishment.
If he knows some of Our verses, he makes a mockery of them. These will have a degrading punishment:
Hell is hot on their heels. What they have acquired will be of no use to them, nor what they have taken as protectors except Allah. They will have a huge punishment.
This [the Qur'an] is a guide. And those who reject the verses of their Lord will be tormented with painful punishment.
Allah is the One who has subdued the sea for you, so that ships may sail in it, by His command, and that you may seek His grace so that you may be grateful.
And He has subdued to you all that is in heaven and on earth, all of which comes from Him. There are signs there for people who are thinking.
Tell those who have believed to forgive those who do not hope for the days of Allah so that He may reward [every] people for the gains they did.
Whoever does good, does it for himself; and whoever acts evil, acts against himself. Then you will be brought back to your Lord,
We did bring to the Children of Israel the Book, wisdom, prophecy, and attributed good things to them, and preferred them to other human beings [their contemporaries];
And We have brought them clear proofs of the Order. They did not diverge until science had come to them through aggressiveness among themselves. Your Lord will decide among them on the Day of Resurrection what they differed in.
Then We set you on the path of Order. Follow it, then, and do not follow the passions of those who do not know.
They will be of no use to you in the sight of Allah. The unjust are truly allies of one another; while Allah is the Protector of the righteous.
This [the Qur'an] is a source of clarity, a guide and a mercy for people who believe with certainty.
Do those who do evil deeds expect that We will treat them like those who believe and do good deeds, in their lives and in their deaths? How badly they judge!
And Allah created the heavens and the earth in all truth and so that every soul would be rewarded according to what he has acquired. However, they will not be harmed.
Do you see the one who takes his passion for his own divinity? And Allah knowingly misleads him and seals his hearing and his heart and spreads a veil over his sight. Who can guide him after Allah? Don't you remember?
And they said, "There is nothing for us but the life of this world: we die and we live, and only time causes us to perish." They have no knowledge of it: they only speculate.
And when we recite Our clear verses to them, their only argument is to say, "Bring back our ancestors if you are truthful."
Say: "Allah gives you life and then He gives you death. Then He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection, there is no doubt about it, but most people don't know.
To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And on the day when the Hour comes, on that day, the impostors will be lost.
And you will see every community kneeling. Each community will be called to its book. You will be paid today according to what you worked.
This is our book. He speaks of you in all truth, for We recorded [everything] that you did."
Those who have believed and done good deeds, their Lord will bring into His mercy. This is the obvious success.
And as for those who disbelieved, "Were not my verses recited to you? But you were puffed up with pride and you were criminal people."
And when it was said: "The promise of Allah is truth; and the Hour is not in doubt", you said: "We do not know what the Hour is; and we were only conjecturing about it, and we are not convinced [that it will happen].
And their evil deeds will appear to them. And what they mocked will surround them.
And they will be told: "Today We forget you as you have forgotten this day's meeting. Your refuge is Fire; and you will have no helpers.
This is because you mocked the verses of Allah and the life of this world deceived you." On that day, they will not be taken out of it, nor will they be excused.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth: Lord of the universe.
And to Him is the greatness in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.
H'â, Mîm.
The revelation of the Book emanates from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.
We have created the heavens and the earth and what is between them only in all truth and [for] a fixed term. Those who have disbelieved turn away from what they have been warned about.
Say: "What do you think of those whom you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth! Or do they have a participation in heaven with God? Bring me a Book prior to this (the Qur'an) or even a remnant of a science, if you are truthful."
And who is more misguided than the one who supplies besides Allah, and life will not be able to answer him until the Day of Resurrection? And they [their deities] are indifferent to their invocation.
And when the people are gathered [for the Judgment], they will be their enemies and will deny their worship [for them].
And when Our clear verses are recited to them, those who have disbelieved say of the truth, when it comes to them: "This is manifest magic."
Or they say, "He invented it!" Say: "If I invented it, then you will not be able to do anything for me against Allah's [punishment]. He knows perfectly well what you are propagating (in slander against the Qur'an): Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you. And He is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful."
Say: "I am not an innovation among the messengers; and I do not know what will be done with me, or with you. I am only following what is revealed to me; and I am only a clear warner."
Say: "What will you say if [this revelation turns out] to be from Allah and you do not believe in it, let a witness among the children of Israel testify to its conformity [to the Pentateuch] and believe in it, while you reject it with pride... Verily, Allah does not guide the unrighteous."
And those who disbelieved said to those who believed, "If this were good, they (the poor) would not have gone ahead of us." And since they will not have let themselves be guided by him, they will say: "This is only an old lie!"
And before him, there was the Book of Moses, as a guide and as a mercy. And this is a confirmatory [Book] in the Arabic language, to warn those who do wrong and to give good news to the doers
Those who say, "Our Lord is Allah" and then stand on the right path. They need have no fear and will not be afflicted.
These are the people of Paradise where they will dwell eternally, as a reward for what they did.
And We enjoined a man to be kind to his father and mother: his mother bore him with difficulty and gave birth to him with difficulty; and its gestation and weaning last thirty months; then when he reaches his full strength and reaches forty years of age, he says, "O Lord! Inspire me to give thanks for the blessing with which You have bestowed upon me and my father and mother, and to do a good work that You are pleased with. And grant that my posterity may be of sound morality. I repent of You and I am one of the Submissive."
These are the ones from whom We accept the best of what they do and pass over their misdeeds, (they will be) among the people of Paradise, according to the truthful promise made to them.
As for the one who says to his father and mother, "Enough of you both! Do you promise me that I will be brought out of the ground when generations before me have passed?" And the two of them, imploring Allah's help, said, "Woe to you! Believe. For Allah's promise is true." But he (answers): "These are only tales of the ancients."
These are the ones who have deserved the sentence at the same time as the communities that have already gone before them among the jinn and men. They were really losers.
And there are ranks [of merit] for each one, according to what they have done so that Allah may give them the full reward of their deeds; and they will not be wronged.
And on the Day when those who have disbelieved shall be presented to the Fire (it shall be said to them): "You have squandered your excellent [goods] and enjoyed them to the full during your life on earth: therefore you are rewarded today with the degrading punishment, for the pride with which you were unjustly puffed up on earth, and for your perversity.
And remember the brother of the 'Aad (Hud) when he warned his people in Al-Ahqaf, when before and after him there were warners: "Worship only Allah. I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day."
They said, "Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods? Well, bring us what you promise us if you are of the truthful."
He said: "Knowledge is only with Allah. However, I am passing on to you the message with which I was sent. But I see that you are ignorant people."
Then, seeing a cloud moving towards their valleys, they said: "Here is a cloud that brings us rain." On the contrary! it is this very thing that you sought to hasten: it is a wind that contains a painful chastisement,
destroying everything, by the command of his Lord. Then the next day nothing was to be seen but their homes. In this way We reward criminal people.
In fact, We had consolidated them in positions that We did not give you. And We had assigned them hearing, eyes, and hearts, but neither their hearing, nor their eyes, nor their hearts benefited them in any way, because they denied the signs of Allah. And what they mocked surrounded them.
We have certainly destroyed the cities around you; and We have diversified the signs so that they may return.
Why, then, do they not help those whom they had taken as gods besides Allah, in order to bring them closer to Him? The latter, on the contrary, abandoned them; such is their deception and this is what they invented as lies.
(Remember) when We led a band of jinn to you to listen to the Qur'an. When they attended [his reading] they said, "Listen carefully"... Then, when it was over, they returned to their people as warners
They said, "O our people! We have just heard a Book that was sent down after Moses, confirming what came before it. It guides to the truth and to a straight path.
O our people! Answer the preacher of Allah and believe in him. He [Allah] will forgive you some of your sins and protect you from painful punishment.
And whoever does not answer the preacher of Allah will not be able to escape the power of the earth. And he will have no protectors besides Him. These are obviously misguided.
Do they not see that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, and who was not weary by their creation, is indeed able to restore life to the dead? Yes, you are. He is certainly Omnipotent.
And on the Day when those who have disbelieved will be presented to the Fire (they will be asked), "Is not this the truth?" They will say, "But yes, by our Lord." He will say, "Well, taste the punishment for your disbelief."
Endure (Muhammad), therefore, as the messengers endowed with firmness endured; and do not be in too much of a hurry to see them suffer [their punishment]. On the day when they see what is promised to them, it will seem to them that they had stayed only an hour of a day. This is a communication. Who will be annihilated if not the evil people?
Those who disbelieved and obstructed the way of Allah, He made their deeds in vain.
And those who believed and did good deeds and believed in what was sent down on Muhammad – and this is the truth coming from their Lord – He erases their misdeeds and improves their condition.
This is so because those who disbelieved followed the False and those who believed followed the Truth emanating from their Lord. This is how Allah offers their examples to the people.
When you meet those who have disbelieved, strike their necks. Then, when you have dominated them, chain them solidly. Then it's either free release or ransom, until the war lays down its burdens. This is so, because if Allah wills, He will take vengeance on them, but it is to test you one by another. And those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never make their deeds in vain.
He will guide them and improve their condition.
and will bring them into the Paradise that He has made known to them.
O you who believe! if you make Allah triumph, He will make you triumph and strengthen your steps.
And as for those who have disbelieved, there will be a calamity for them, and He will make their works in vain.
This is because they have revulsion for what Allah has sent down. He has therefore rendered their works in vain.
Have they not traveled the earth to see what has become of their predecessors? Allah has destroyed them. Such ends are reserved for the disbelievers.
It is because Allah is truly the Protector of those who believe; while the disbelievers have no protector.
Those who believe and do good deeds, Allah will bring them into gardens under which streams flow. And those who disbelieve enjoy and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their place of abode.
And how many cities, much stronger than your city that expelled you, have We put to death, and they had no helper.
Is he who bases himself on a clear proof from his Lord comparable to those whose evil deeds have been embellished and who have followed their own passions?
This is the description of Paradise that has been promised to the righteous: there will be streams of water that is never smelly, and streams of milk that tastes unalterable, and streams of wine that is delicious to drink, and streams of purified honey. And there are fruits of all kinds for them, as well as forgiveness from their Lord. Will they be like those who linger in the Fire and are watered with boiling water that tears their entrails?
And there are some among them who listen to you. When they come out of your house, they say to those who have received knowledge, "What did he say earlier?" These are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed and who follow their own passions.
As for those who set out on the right path, He guided them still more and inspired them with their piety.
What are they waiting for if not for the Hour to come to them unexpectedly? But its warning signs have certainly already come. And how will they be able to remember when it comes to them (out of the blue)?
Know, then, that there is no god but Allah, and beg forgiveness for your sin, as well as for the believers. Allah knows your activities (on earth) and your resting place (in the Hereafter).
Those who have believed say: "Ah! If a Surah came down!" Then, when an explicit Surah is sent down and the fight is mentioned, you see those who have a disease in their hearts looking at you with the gaze of one who faints before death. Would be much better for them.
obedience and proper speech. Then, when the matter is decided, it would be better for them to be sincere with Allah.
If you turn away, don't you risk sowing corruption on earth and severing your kinship ties?
These are the ones whom Allah has cursed, deafened and blinded their eyes.
Do they not meditate on the Qur'an? Or are there padlocks on their hearts?
Those who retraced their steps after the right path was clearly laid out to them, the Devil deceived and deceived them.
This is because they said to those who have revulsion for Allah's revelation, "We will obey you in certain things." Allah, however, knows what they are hiding.
What will become of them when the angels finish them off, striking their faces and backs?
This is because they have followed what angers Allah, and they are repulsive for His pleasure. He has therefore made their works vain.
Or do those who have a heart disease expect that Allah will never be able to show their hatred?
Now, if We wanted to show them to you. You would certainly recognize them by their features; and you would most certainly recognize them by the tone of your speech to them. And Allah knows your deeds well.
We will certainly test you in order to distinguish those of you who strive [for the cause of Allah] and who endure, and in order to test [to bring to light] your news.
Those who disbelieved and obstructed the path of Allah and joined the clan opposed to the Messenger after the right path was clearly explained to them, will not harm Allah in any way. He will make their works vain.
O you who have believed! Obey Allah, obey the Messenger, and do not make your deeds in vain.
Those who disbelieved and obstructed the path of Allah and then died while being disbelievers, Allah will never forgive them.
So do not weaken and do not call for peace when you are the highest, Allah is with you, and He will never deprive you of your deeds.
The present life is nothing but play and amusement; whereas if you believe and fear, [Allah] will give you your rewards and will not ask you for your goods.
If He asked you for them importunately, you would become miserly and He would show your hatreds.
You are called to spend money in the way of Allah. Some of you are being stingy. Whoever is miserly, however, is miserly to his detriment. Allah is Self-Sufficient while you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you with a people other than you, and they will not be like you.
Verily We have granted you a resounding victory,
that Allah may forgive you your sins, past and future, that He may complete His blessing on you and guide you to a straight path;
and may Allah give you mighty help.
It is He who has brought tranquility into the hearts of believers so that they may add faith to their faith. To Allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is All-Knowing and Wise
so that He may bring believers into Gardens under which streams flow, where they will dwell forever, and to blot out their misdeeds. This is a huge success with Allah.
And that He may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the associates, who think evil of Allah. May an evil spell fall on them. Allah is wrathful with them, has cursed them, and has prepared Hell for them. What a bad destination!
To Allah belong the armies of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Mighty and Wise.
We have sent you as a witness, a proclaimer of the good news and a warner,
so that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger, honor Him, recognize His dignity, and glorify Him morning and night.
Those who swear allegiance to you are only swearing an oath to Allah: the hand of Allah is above their hands. Whoever violates the oath violates it only to his own detriment; and whoever fulfills his commitment to Allah, He will soon bring him a huge reward.
Those of the Bedouins who have been left behind will say to you: "Our property and our families have held us back: therefore beg forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: "Who can do anything for you with Allah if He wants to harm you or if He wants to do you good? But Allah is Perfectly Knower of what you are doing.
Rather, you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families again. And it has been beautified for you in your hearts; and you have had bad thoughts. And you were lost people."
And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger... so We have prepared a fiery furnace for the disbelievers.
To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whomever He wills and chastises whomever He wills. However, Allah remains, Forgiving and Merciful.
Those who remained behind will say, when you go to the booty to seize it; "Let us follow you." They would like to change the word of Allah. Say: "You will never follow us, for so Allah has already announced." But they will say, "You are rather envious of us." But in reality they understood very little.
Say to those of the Bedouins who remained behind, "You will soon be called upon against people of formidable strength. You will fight them unless they embrace Islam, if you obey, Allah will give you a great reward, and if you turn away as you have turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment."
No grievance is to be made against the blind, nor the lame nor the sick. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will bring him into the Gardens under which the streams flow. Whoever turns away, however, He will punish him with a painful punishment.
Allah most certainly accepted the believers when they swore the oath of allegiance to you under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, and brought quietude down upon them, and rewarded them with an early victory.
as well as abundant booty that they will collect. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
Allah has promised you abundant booty that you will take, and He has hastened it for you and pushed away the hands of the people from you, so that all this may be a sign to the believers and guide you to the right path.
He promises you another booty that you will never be able to take and that Allah has embraced in His power, for Allah is Omnipotent.
And if those who have disbelieved fight you, they will turn away, verily; then they will find neither ally nor helper.
This is Allah's rule applied to past generations. And you will never find a change in Allah's rule.
It is He who in the valley of Mecca has removed their hands from you, just as He has removed your hands from them, after He has made you triumph over them. And Allah sees perfectly what you are doing.
They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed your way to the Holy Mosque [and prevented] the fettered offerings from reaching their place of immolation. If there had not been believing men and believing women (among the Meccans) whom you did not know and whom you could have unknowingly trampled on, thus making you guilty of a reprehensible deed... [All this was done] so that Allah might bring in whomever He wills into His mercy. And if they [the believers] had stood out, We would certainly have punished with a painful punishment those who had disbelieved among [the Meccans].
When those who disbelieved had put in their hearts the fury, [the] fury of ignorance... Then Allah sent down His peace of Allah upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and compelled them to a word of piety, of which they were the most worthy and close. Allah is All-Knowing.
Allah was truthful in the vision in which He announced to His Messenger in all truth: You will enter the Holy Mosque if Allah wills, in safety, having shaved your heads or cut your hair, without any fear. So he knew what you didn't. He placed a close victory below that (the truce of Hudaybiya).
It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth [Islam] to make it triumph over all other religions. Allah is sufficient as a witness.
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are harsh to the disbelievers, merciful to one another. You see them bowing, prostrate, seeking from Allah grace and pleasure. Their faces are marked by the trace left by prostration. This is their image in the Torah. And the image that is given of them in the Gospel is that of a seed that comes out of its shoot, then becomes firm, thickened, and then stands on its stalk, to the wonder of the sowers. [Allah] through them [the believers] fills the disbelievers with vexation. Allah promises those among them who believe and do good deeds, forgiveness and a huge reward.
O you who have believed! Do not precede Allah and His Messenger. And fear Allah. Allah is Hearing and All-Knowing.
O you who have believed! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor raise your voice when speaking to him, as you raise it with one another, or your deeds will become in vain without your realizing it.
Those who bow their voices to the Messenger of Allah are those whose hearts Allah has tested for piety. They will have forgiveness and a huge reward.
Those who call you out loud from behind the apartments, most of them don't reason.
And if they waited until you came out to them, it would certainly be better for them. Allah, however, is Forgiving and Merciful.
O you who have believed! If a wicked person brings you news, see clearly that you are inadvertently harming people and then regretting what you have done.
And know that the Messenger of Allah is among you. If he obeyed you in many matters, you would be in trouble. But Allah has made you love the faith and has made it more beautiful in your hearts and has made you hate disbelief, evil and disobedience. These are the rightly led,
this is indeed a grace of Allah and a blessing. Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And if two groups of believers are fighting each other, make conciliation between them. If one of them rebels against the other, fight the group that is rebelling, until they comply with Allah's command. Then, if he does so, reconcile them with justice and be fair, for Allah loves the fair.
Believers are only brothers. Establish harmony among your brothers, and fear Allah, so that you may have mercy.
O you who have believed! Let one group not make fun of another group: the latter may be better than them. And let no women make fun of other women: they may be better than them. Do not denigrate each other or hurl (insulting) monikes at each other. What a nasty word "perversion" when you already have faith. And whoever does not repent... These are the unjust.
O you who have believed! Avoid conjecturing too much, for some conjecture is sinful. And don't spy; and do not slander one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? (No!) you will abhor it. And fear Allah. For Allah is Great, Welcoming to repentance, Most Merciful.
O men! We have created you from a male and a female, and We have made you nations and tribes, so that you may know one another. The noblest of you, in the sight of Allah, is the most pious. Allah is indeed All-Knowing, and the Great Knower.
The Bedouins said, "We have faith." Say: "You don't have faith yet. Say instead, We have simply submitted, for faith has not yet penetrated into your hearts. And if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not cause you to lose any of your deeds." Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
The true believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, who do not doubt and who strive with their possessions and their persons in the way of Allah. These are the truthful ones.
Say: "Are you the ones who will teach Allah your religion, when Allah knows all that is in the heavens and on the earth?" And Allah is All-Knowing.
They remind you of their conversion to Islam as if it were a favor on their part. Say: "Do not remind me of your conversion to Islam as a favor. On the contrary, it is a favor that Allah has bestowed upon you by directing you to faith, if you are truthful."
Allah knows the Unknowable of the heavens and the earth and Allah is Clairvoyant about what you do.
Qâf. By the glorious Qur'an!
But they are astonished that one of their number came to them as a warner; and the disbelievers said, "This is an amazing thing.
What! When we are dead and reduced to dust...? That would be a long way back!"
Verily, We know what the earth will eat away at them [their bodies]; and We have a Book in which all things are preserved.
Rather, they call the truth that has come to them a lie, and so they are in a confused situation.
Have they not observed the heavens above them, how We have built it and beautified it; And how it is crack-free?
And the earth We have spread out, and We have driven mountains firmly into it, and have caused all kinds of beautiful couples of [plants] to grow in it,
as a call to clairvoyance and a reminder to every repentant servant.
And We sent down blessed water from heaven, with which We made gardens grow and the grain that is harvested,
as well as the tall palm trees with superimposed regimes,
as a sustenance for the servants. And by it (water) We have given life to a dead land. Thus will the resurrection take place.
Before them, the people of Noah, the people of Ar-Rass and the Thamûd cried false,
and the 'Aad and Pharaoh and the brothers of Lot,
and the people of Al-Aykah and the people of Tubba'. All of them called the Messengers liars. This is how My threat was justified.
What? Have We been weary with the first creation? But they are confused about a new creation.
We have indeed created man and We know what his soul suggests to him and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein
when the two collectors, seated on the right and left, collect.
He does not utter a word without having an observer ready to record it.
The agony of death brings out the truth: "This is what you were departing from."
And they will blow into the Trunk: This is the Day of Threat.
Then each soul will come accompanied by a leader and a witness.
"You were indifferent to that. Well, We take off your veil; your sight is sharp today.
And his companion will say, "This is what is with me, ready."
"You two, cast into Hell every hardened and rebellious disbeliever,
relentless in preventing good, transgressor, doubter,
the one who placed another deity next to Allah. Throw him into harsh punishment."
His comrade (the Devil) will say: "Lord, it was not I who made him transgress; but he was already in a deep delusion."
Then [Allah] will say: "Do not quarrel before me! While I have already told you about the threat.
With Me, the word does not change; and I do not oppress the servants in any way."
On the day when We say to Hell; "Are you full?" He'll say, "Is there any more?"
Paradise will be brought closer to the stakes.
"This is what has been promised to you, [and] to every man full of repentance and respectful [of God's prescriptions]
who fears the Most Merciful though he does not see Him, and who comes [to Him] with a heart inclined to obedience.
Enter safely." This is the day of eternity!
There will be everything they want for them. And with Us there is still more.
How many generations far stronger than they have destroyed before them. They had traveled through the country, seeking [in vain] where to flee.
This is a reminder to anyone with a heart, lend an ear while witnessing.
For We created the heavens and the earth and all that exists between them in six days, without the slightest weariness.
Endure therefore what they say; and praise thy Lord before the rising of the sun and before [its] setting;
and celebrates His glory, part of the night and after prostrations [prayers].
And listen, on the day when the crier cries out from a near place,
the day when they will hear the Cry in all truth. This is the Day of Resurrection.
It is We who give life and give death, and to Us will be the destination,
the day when the earth is split, [rejecting] them precipitately. It will be an easy gathering for Us.
We know better what they are saying. It is not your mission to coerce them. Therefore call back from the Qur'an the one who fears My threat.
By the winds that scatter!
By the burden bearers!
By the agile sliders!
By distributors according to a commandment!
What is promised to you is certainly true.
And the Retribution will inevitably come.
By the sky of perfectly marked paths!
You disagree on what you say.
Whoever has been turned away from the faith is turned away from him.
Cursed be the liars,
who are immersed in carelessness.
They ask, "When will the Day of Retribution come?"
On the Day when they will be tested in the Fire:
"Taste your trial [punishment]; this is what you were trying to hasten."
The stakes will be in gardens and springs,
receiving what their Lord has given them. For they were previously beneficial:
they slept little at night,
and in the last hours of the night they implored forgiveness [from Allah];
and in their property there was a right to the beggar and the disinherited.
There is evidence on earth for those who believe with certainty;
as well as in yourselves. Do you not observe?
And there is in heaven your sustenance and what has been promised to you.
By the Lord of heaven and earth! This is just as true as the fact that you are speaking.
Has the account of Abraham's honorable visitors come down to you?
When they came to his house and said, "Peace," he said, "Peace, unknown visitors."
Then he went discreetly to his family and brought a fattened calf.
Then he brought him close to them... "Don't you eat?" he said.
He then felt fear of them. They said, "Do not be afraid." And they told him [of the birth] of a boy full of knowledge.
Then his wife came screaming, struck her face, and said, "An old barren woman..."
They said, "Thus says your Lord. He is truly the Wise, the All-Knowing."
Then [Abraham] said, "What is your mission, O messengers?"
They said, "We have been sent to criminal people,
to throw stones of clay at them,
marked with your Lord for the sake of the outrageous."
We then brought out of it what believers were,
but We found there only one house of submissive people.
And We left there a sign for those who fear the painful punishment;
[There is even a sign] in Moses when We sent him, with clear proof, to Pharaoh.
But [the latter] turned away, trusting in his power, and said, "He is a magician or a possessed man!"
We seized him and his troops, and then threw them into the waves for his reprehensible behavior.
The same is true of the 'Aad, when We sent the devastating wind against them
sparing nothing in its path without reducing it to dust.
The same was true of the Thamûd, when it was said to them: "Enjoy until a certain time!"
They defied the command of their Lord. Lightning struck them as they watched.
They could neither stand up nor be rescued.
The same was true of Noah's people before. They were perverted people.
We have built heaven by Our power, and We are constantly extending it into immensity.
And the earth We have expanded. And in what an excellent way we leveled it!
And from all things We have created [two elements] of couple. Maybe you'll remember?
"Flee to Allah. I am an explicit warner for you on His behalf.
Do not place another deity with Allah. I am an explicit warner for you from Him."
Thus, no Messenger came to their predecessors without them saying, "He is a magician or a possessed man."
Did they pass on this injunction to each other? They are rather transgressors.
Turn away from them, you will not be blamed [for them].
And recalls; for the remembrance benefits the believers.
I created the jinn and men only to worship Me.
I do not seek sustenance from them; and I don't want them to feed me.
Verily, it is Allah who is the Great Provider, the Possessor of Strength, the Unshakable.
Those who have been unjust will have a share [of torments] equal to that of their companions. Let them not be in too much of a hurry.
Woe then to those who have disbelieved because of the day with which they are threatened!
By At-Tûr!
And by a book written
on an unfolded parchment!
And by the People's House!
And by the High Vault!
And by the Sea brought to a boil! (on the Last Day)
Your Lord's chastisement will inevitably take place.
No one will be able to push him away.
On the day when the sky is agitated by a whirlwind,
and the mountains will march.
On that day, woe to those who call (the signs of Allah) lies,
those who frolic in frivolous speeches
the day they will be brutally pushed into the fire of Hell:
This is the fire you called a lie.
Is this magic? Or do you not see clearly?
Burn in it! Bear or not endure, it will be the same for you: you are only rewarded according to what you did.
The pious will be in gardens and in delights,
rejoicing in what their Lord has given them, and their Lord has protected them from the punishment of the Furnace.
"As a reward for what you did, eat and drink in peace,
leaning on tidy beds," and We will make them marry houris with large black eyes,
Those who believe and their descendants follow in the faith, We will cause their descendants to join them. And We will not diminish the merit of their deeds in any way, each one being held responsible for what he has acquired.
We will provide them abundantly with the fruits and meats they desire.
There they will pass a cup to each other that will provoke neither vanity nor incrimination.
And among them will circulate boys in their service, like well-preserved pearls.
And they will turn to one another, wondering;
They will say: "We lived among our own people in fear [of Allah];
Then Allah favored us and protected us from the punishment of Samûm.
Previously, we invoked Him. He is certainly the Charitable, the Most Merciful."
Remember, then, and by the grace of your Lord you are neither a soothsayer nor a possessed person.
Or they say, "He's a poet! Let's wait for him to die."
Say: "Wait! I am with you among those who wait."
Is it their reason that commands them to do this? Or are they outrageous people?
Or do they say, "He invented it himself?" No... but they do not believe.
Well, let them produce a narration like it (the Qur'an), if they are truthful.
Were they created from scratch or are they the creators?
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? But they have no convictions.
Do they possess the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the sovereign masters?
Do they have a scale from which they listen? Let the one of their own who remains attentive provide clear proof!
Would [Allah] have the daughters, while you have the sons?
Or do you ask them for a salary, so that they are burdened with a heavy debt?
Or do they hold the Unknowable to mention it in writing?
Or are they looking for a scheme? But it is those who have disbelieved who are the victims of their own stratagem.
Or do they have any other god besides Allah? May Allah be glorified and purified from all that they associate.
And if they see fragments of the sky falling, they say, "These are superimposed clouds."
Leave them, then, until they meet their day when they will be struck by lightning,
the day when their cunning will be of no use to them, when they will not be helped.
The unrighteous will have a prior punishment. But most of them don't know.
And patiently bear the decision of your Lord. For verily you are before Our eyes. And praise the glory of your Lord when you arise;
Glorify Him a part of the night and the setting of the stars.
By the star in its waning!
Your companion has not lost his way or been misled
and he pronounces nothing under the effect of passion;
it is nothing but an inspired revelation.
Which [Angel Gabriel] taught him with prodigious strength,
gifted with sagacity; it was then that he showed himself in his real [angelic] form,
while he was on the upper horizon.
Then he came closer and went down even lower,
and was within two bow ranges, or nearer.
He revealed to His servant what He revealed.
The heart has not lied in what it has seen.
Do you dispute with him what he sees?
Yet he saw him, during another descent,
near the Sidrat-ul-Muntahâ,
near it is the garden of Ma'w?:
at the moment when the lotus was covered with what covered it.
the sight has in no way deviated or exceeded the measure.
He saw well some of the great wonders of his Lord.
What do you think of [the deities], Lât and Uuzzâ
as well as Manat, this third other?
Will it be yours the boy and Him the girl?
What an unjust division!
These are just names that you and your ancestors have invented. Allah has not sent down any evidence about them. They follow only the conjecture and passions of [their] souls, whereas the guidance has come to them from their Lord.
Or will man have everything he desires?
To Allah belong the future life and the life of this world.
And how many angels in the heavens whose intercession is of no use, except after Allah has permitted it, for whom He wills and whom He pleases.
Those who do not believe in the Hereafter give the Angels the names of women,
whereas they have no knowledge of it: they follow only conjecture, whereas conjecture is of no use against truth.
Depart from him who turns his back on Our call and desires only the present life.
This is the whole scope of their knowledge. Verily your Lord knows perfectly well the one who strays from His path and He knows perfectly well those who are rightly guided.
To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and on the earth, so that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and reward those who do good with the best [reward].
those who avoid the greatest sins and turpitude, and only slight sins. Certainly, your Lord's forgiveness is immense. He knows you best when He produced you from the earth, and also when you were embryos in your mothers' wombs. Do not boast of your purity yourselves; it is He who knows best those who fear [Him].
Do you see the one who has turned away,
gave little and [finally] stopped giving?
Does he possess the knowledge of the Unknowable so that he sees?
Was he not told what was in the leaves of Moses?
and those of Abraham who perfectly fulfilled [his promise to transmit]
that no [soul] shall bear the burden (sin) of another,
and that in truth man obtains only [the fruit] of his efforts;
and that his effort, in truth, will be presented to him (on the Day of Judgment).
Then he will be fully rewarded,
and that all things end in truth to your Lord,
and that it is He who has made people laugh and who has made them cry,
and that it is He who has caused death and brought back to life,
and that it is He who created the two elements of the couple, the male and the female,
a drop of semen when it is ejaculated
and that the second creation devolves upon Him,
and it is He who has enriched and made acquired.
And He is the Lord of Sirius,
and it is He who destroyed the elder 'Aad,
and the Thamûd, and He caused nothing to remain of it,
and the people of Noah before, for they were even more unjust and violent,
just as He annihilates the overthrown cities.
And covered them with what He covered them with.
Which of your Lord's blessings do you doubt?
Here is a horn similar to the old horns:
the Imminent (Hour of Judgment) is approaching.
Nothing else but Allah can reveal it.
What! Are you surprised at this discourse (the Qur'an)?
And you laugh at it and cry not about it?
absorbed [that you are] by your distraction.
Therefore bow down to Allah and worship Him.
The Hour is approaching and the Moon has split.
And if they see a prodigy, they turn away from it and say, "Persistent magic."
And they call [him] a lie and follow their own impulses, but everything will come to an end.
Yet they have received as news what to prevent them (from evil);
[This is] perfect wisdom. But warnings are of no use to [them].
Turn away from them. On the day when the caller calls to something awful,
with downcast eyes, they will come out of the graves like scattered locusts,
running, with his neck outstretched, towards the caller. The disbelievers will say, "This is a difficult day."
Before them, Noah's people had cried lies. They called Our servant a liar and said, "He is possessed!" and he was repulsed.
So he called on his Lord: "I am defeated. Make (Your Cause) triumph."
We then opened the gates of heaven to torrential water,
and caused the earth to gush forth in springs. The waters met according to an order that had already been decreed in a thing [done].
And We carried it on an object [made] of planks and nails [the ark],
sailing before Our eyes: reward for him whom they had denied [Noah].
And We left it, as a sign. Is there anyone to think?
How were My chastisements and My warnings?
Indeed, We have made the Qur'an easy for meditation. Is there anyone to think?
The 'Aad called (their Messenger) a liar. How were My chastisements and My warnings?
We have sent against them a violent and icy wind, in a bad and interminable day;
he was tearing people up like stumps of uprooted palm trees.
How were My chastisements and My warnings?
Indeed, We have made the Qur'an easy for meditation. Is there anyone to think?
The Thamûd have called the warnings lies.
They said, "Are we going to follow one man (Sālih) from among ourselves? We would then be in a state of bewilderment and madness.
Was the message sent to Him except for all of us? He is rather a great liar, full of pretension and pride."
Tomorrow they will know who the great liar is full of pretentiousness and pride.
We will send them the camel as a trial. So keep an eye on them and be patient.
And inform them that the water will be shared between them [and the she-camel]; everyone will drink in turn.
Then they called their comrade, who took [his sword] and killed [it].
How, then, were My chastisements and My warnings?
We let out a single cry on them, and behold, they were reduced to the state of stable straw.
And truly, We have made the Qur'an easy for meditation. Is there anyone to think?
Lot's people called the warnings lies.
We let loose a hurricane on them, except the family of Lot, whom We saved before dawn,
as a blessing on Our part: thus do We reward the one who is grateful.
He had, however, warned them of Our reprisals. But they questioned the warnings.
Indeed, they wanted to seduce his guests. We blinded their eyes, "Taste therefore My chastisement and My warnings."
Indeed, in the early morning, a persistent chastisement surprised them.
Taste therefore My chastisement and My warnings.
And truly, We have made the Qur'an easy for meditation. Is there anyone to think?
Warnings came to Pharaoh's people.
They called all Our wonders lies. We therefore seized them, with the grasp of a Mighty Omnipotent.
Are your disbelievers better than these? Or is there an immunity to you in the Scriptures?
Or they say, "We are a [strong] group and we will win."
Their gathering will soon be routed, and they will flee.
Rather, the Hour will be their rendezvous, and the Hour will be more terrible and bitter.
Criminals are certainly bewildered and mad.
On the Day when they are dragged into the Fire over their faces, (they will be told): "Taste the touch of Saqar [the burning heat of Hell]".
We have created everything with measure,
and Our order is one [word]; [he's quick] like the twinkling of an eye.
For we have destroyed peoples like you. Is there anyone to remember it?
And everything they did is recorded in the records,
and everything, small and large, is recorded.
The stakes will be in gardens and among streams,
in a sojourn of truth, with an Omnipotent Sovereign.
The Most Merciful.
He taught the Koran.
He created man.
He taught him to express himself clearly.
The sun and the moon [evolve] according to [minute] calculation.
And the grass and the trees prostrate themselves.
And as for heaven, He has raised it very high. And He set the scales,
so that you do not transgress in the weighing:
Give [always] the exact weight and do not distort the weighing.
As for the earth, He has extended it for living beings:
there are fruits there, and also palm trees with fruits covered with husks,
as well as grains in their husks, and aromatic plants.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
He created man of sounding clay like pottery;
and He created the jinn from the flame of a smokeless fire.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Lord of the two Levants and Lord of the two Sunsets!
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
He gave free rein to the two seas to meet;
there is a barrier between them that they do not overcome.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
From these two [seas] come pearl and coral.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
To Him belong the ships raised on the sea like mountains.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Everything on it [the earth] must disappear,
[Only] the Face [Wajh] of your Lord will remain, full of majesty and nobility.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Those who are in heaven and earth implore Him. Every day He accomplishes a new work.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
We will soon begin your judgment, O you two burdens [men and jinn].
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
O people of jinn and men! If you can get out of the realm of heaven and earth, then do it. But you will only be able to get out of it with the help of [unlimited] power.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
A jet of fire and smoke [or molten copper] will be hurled at you, and you will not be helped.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Then when the sky splits and becomes scarlet like red leather.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Then neither men nor jinn will be asked questions about their sins.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Criminals will be recognized by their features. They will therefore be seized by the toupees and the feet.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
This is the Hell that criminals treated as a lie.
They will go back and forth between it (Hell) and extremely hot boiling water.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
And for him who is afraid to appear before his Lord, there are two gardens;
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
With bushy branches.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
They will find two common sources there.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
They contain two species of each fruit.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
They will be leaning on carpets lined with brocade, and the fruits of the two gardens will be within their reach (to be picked).
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
There they will find [the houris] with chaste looks, whom no man or jinn before them has deflowered.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
They will be [as beautiful] as ruby and coral.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Is there any other reward for good than good?
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Below these two gardens there will be two other gardens.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
They are dark green.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
In which there will be two springs gushing out.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
They contain fruits, palms, and pomegranate trees.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
There, there will be virtuous and beautiful women.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Houris cloistered in tents,
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
that before them no man or jinn has deflowered.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
They will be leaning on green cushions and thick, pretty carpets.
Which of your Lord's blessings will you deny?
Blessed be the Name of your Lord, Full of Majesty and Munificence!
When the event (the Judgment) happens,
no one will call his coming a lie.
He will lower (some), he will exalt (others).
When the earth is violently shaken,
and the mountains will be reduced to smithereens,
and that they will become scattered dust
Then you will be three categories:
People on the Right - What are people on the right?
And the people on the left - what are the people on the left?
They are the first to be the first (to follow Allah's orders on earth) and they will be the first (in the Hereafter)
These are the ones closest to Allah
in the Gardens of Earthly Delights,
a multitude of the chosen among the first [generations],
and a few among the last [generations],
on beds adorned [with gold and jewels],
leaning on it and facing each other.
Among them will circulate boys eternally young,
with cups, ewers, and a glass [filled] with a spring liquor
that will not cause them headaches or dizziness;
and fruits of their choice,
and any bird's flesh they desire.
And they will have houris in their eyes, large and beautiful,
like shell beads
as a reward for what they did.
They will hear neither futility nor blasphemy;
but only the words: "Salam! Salâm!" ... [Peace! Peace!]
And the people on the right; What are the people of the right?
[They will be among] thornless jujube trees,
and among banana trees with well-stocked bunches,
in Extended Shadow
[near] water flowing continuously,
and abundant fruits
neither interrupted nor forbidden,
on raised beds,
It is We who have created them to perfection,
and We made them virgins,
graceful, all of the same age,
for people on the right,
a multitude of the chosen among the first [generations],
and a multitude of the chosen ones among the last [generations].
And the people on the left; What are people on the left?
they will be in the midst of a burning breath and boiling water,
in the shade of black smoke
neither fresh nor sweet.
They used to live in luxury.
They persisted in the great sin [polytheism]
and said, "When we die and are dust and bones, will we be resurrected?
as well as our ancient ancestors?.."
Say: "Verily the first and the last
will be gathered for the appointment of a known day".
And then you, the misguided, who called (the Resurrection) a lie,
you will certainly eat from a Zaqqum tree.
you will fill your belly with it,
then you shall drink boiling water over it,
you will drink it as thirsty camels drink.
This is the welcome meal that will be served to them on the day of Retribution.
It is We who have created you. Why should you not believe [in the resurrection]?
So do you see what you're ejaculating:
Are you the one who creates it or are We the Creator?
We have predetermined death among you. We will not be hindered
to replace you with your fellow-creatures, and to make you reborn in [a state] which you do not know.
You knew the first creation. Don't you remember?
Do you see what you are ploughing?
Are you the one who grows it? Where are We the cultivator?
If We wished, We would reduce it to rubble. And you would not cease to be amazed and [to cry out]:
"Here we are in debt!
or rather, exposed to deprivation".
Do you see the water you drink?
Was it you who brought him down from the cloud? Where are We the descender?
If We wanted, We would make it salty. Why are you not grateful?
Do you see the fire you get by rubbing?
Are you the one who created his tree or are We the Creator?
We have made it a reminder (of Hell), and a useful element for those who need it.
Glorify therefore the name of your Lord, the Most Great!
No!.. I swear by the positions of the stars (in the firmament).
And that's just a solemn oath, if you knew.
And it is certainly a noble Qur'an,
in a well-kept book
which only the purified touch;
It is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe.
Is it this speech that you call a lie?
And is it for you to call (the Qur'an) a lie?
When the breath of life rises to the throat (of a dying man),
and at that moment you are looking,
and that We are nearer to him than you [who surround him] but you do not see [him].
Why, then, if you believe that you are not accountable,
Do you not bring it back [this soul], if you are truthful?
If he is one of those who are close to Allah,
then (he will have) rest, grace and a Garden of delights.
And if he is one of the people of the right,
it will be [greeted with these words]: "Peace to you" from the people of the right.
And if he is one of those who had called (the resurrection) a lie and had gone astray,
then it will be placed in boiling water,
and it will burn in the Furnace.
This is full certainty.
Glorify therefore the name of your Lord, the Most Great!
Everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.
To Him belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and he causes death, and He is Omnipotent.
He is the First and the Last, the Apparent and the Hidden, and He is All-Knowing.
He created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then set Himself on the throne; He knows what goes into the earth and what goes out of it, and what comes down from heaven and what goes up there, and He is with you wherever you are. And Allah is watching perfectly what you do.
To Him belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. And to Allah all is brought back.
He makes the night penetrate into the day and the day into the night, and He knows perfectly well the contents of the breasts.
Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend of what He has given you the lieutenancy of. Those of you who believe and spend [for the sake of Allah] will have a great reward.
And what is the matter with you not believing in Allah, when the Messenger calls you to believe in your Lord? And [Allah] has already made your commitment if you are [sincere] in your faith.
It is He who sends down clear verses upon His servant, that He may bring you out of darkness into light; and surely Allah is Merciful to you, and Most Merciful.
And what do you have not to spend in the way of Allah, when Allah is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth? However, one cannot compare the one among you who gave away your property and fought before the conquest... The latter are higher in the hierarchy than those who spent and fought afterward. To each of you, Allah has promised the greatest reward, and Allah is the Great Knower of what you do.
Whoever makes a sincere loan to Allah, Allah multiplies it for him, and he will have a generous reward.
On the day when you see the believers, their light running before them and at their right hand; (they will be told): "This is good news for you today: Gardens under which the streams flow, to dwell in them forever." Such is the enormous success.
The day when the hypocrites, men and women, will say to those who believe, "Wait until we borrow [a little] from your light." It will be said, "Go back and seek light." It was then that a wall was erected between them, with a door whose interior contains mercy, and whose face has before it punishment [Hell].
"Weren't we with you?" they will shout at them. "Yes," [the others] will reply, "but you have been tempted, you have plotted (against the believers) and you have doubted and vain hopes have deceived you, until the command of Allah came. And the deceiver, [the devil] has deceived you about Allah.
Today, therefore, no ransom will be accepted from you or from those who have disbelieved. Your refuge is the Fire: it is the Fire that is your inseparable companion. And what a bad destination!
Has not the time come for those who have believed, let their hearts humble themselves at the remembrance of Allah and before what has come down from the truth [the Qur'an]? And not to be like those who received the Book before them. They found the time long enough, and their hearts hardened, and many of them are perverse.
Know that Allah restores life to the earth when it is dead. Verily, We have made the evidence clear to you so that you may reason.
Those who give charity and have made a sincere loan to Allah, it will be multiplied for them and they will have a generous reward.
Those who believed in Allah and His Messengers are the great truthful and witnesses to Allah. They will have their reward and their light, while those who have disbelieved and called Our signs lies, these will be the people of the Furnace.
Know that this life is nothing but play, amusement, vain adornment, a race for pride among you and a rivalry in the acquisition of wealth and children. In this it is like rain: the vegetation that comes from it amazes the farmers, then it withers and you see it yellowed; then it becomes debris. And in the Hereafter, there is harsh punishment, and also forgiveness and Allah's approval. And the present life is nothing but deceptive enjoyment.
Hasten to a forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as wide as heaven and earth, prepared for those who have believed in Allah and His Messengers. This is the grace of Allah that He gives to whomever He wills. And Allah is the Possessor of great grace.
No misfortune befalls the earth or your persons that is not recorded in a Book before We created it; and this is indeed easy for Allah,
so that you do not worry about what has escaped you, nor rejoice for what He has given you. And Allah does not love all presumptuous and glorious things.
Those who are miserly and command people to be greedy. And whoever turns away... Then Allah is sufficient in Himself and He is worthy of praise.
We have indeed sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and sent down with them the Book and the scales, so that the people may establish righteousness. And We have sent down iron, in which there is a formidable force, as well as benefits for the people, and so that Allah may recognize who in the Unseen will defend His cause and that of His Messengers. Verily, Allah is Mighty and Mighty.
We did send Noah and Abraham and bestowed prophecy and the Book on their descendants. Some of them were rightly guided, while many of them were perverse.
Then, following in their footsteps, We sent for Our [other] messengers, and We made them follow Jesus son of Mary and brought him the gospel, and put in the hearts of those who followed him meekness and meekness. The monasticism which they invented We have in no way prescribed to them. [They should] only seek the pleasure of Allah. But they did not observe it (this monasticism) as it should. We have given their reward to those of them who believed. But many of them were perverts.
O you who have believed! Fear Allah and believe in His Messenger that He may grant you two parts of His mercy, and that He may assign you a light with which you may walk, and that He may forgive you, for Allah is Forgiving and Most Merciful.
This is so that the People of the Book may know that they cannot have the grace of Allah and that the grace is in the hand of Allah. He gives it to whomever He wills, and Allah is the Possessor of immense grace.
Allah heard the words of the one who was arguing with you about her husband and complaining to Allah. And Allah heard your conversation, for Allah is Hearer and Clairvoyant.
Those of you who divorce your wives, declaring that they are to you like the backs of their mothers. whereas they are not their mothers at all, for their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. They are certainly speaking a blameworthy and lying word. Allah, however, is Forgiving and Forgiving.
Those who compare their wives to their mothers' backs and then go back on what they have said, must free a slave before they have any [conjugal] contact with their wives. This is what we urge you to do. And Allah is Perfectly Aware of what you are doing
But one who cannot afford to do so must fast for two consecutive months before having any contact with his wife. But if he cannot do it either, then let him feed sixty poor people. This is so that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger. These are the limits imposed by Allah. And the disbelievers will have a painful punishment.
Those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be overthrown as their predecessors were overthrown. We have already sent down explicit proofs, and the disbelievers will have a degrading punishment,
On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all and then inform them of what they have done, Allah has counted it and they will have forgotten it. Allah is witness to all things.
Do you not see that Allah knows what is in the heavens and on the earth? No secret conversation between three without Him being their fourth, nor between five without Him being their sixth, or less or more than that without Him being with them where they are. Then He will inform them on the Day of Resurrection of what they were doing, for Allah is All-Knowing.
Do you not see those to whom secret conversations have been forbidden? Then they return to what has been forbidden to them, and concert together to sin, transgress, and disobey the Messenger. And when they come to you, they greet you in a way that Allah has not greeted you, and say to themselves, "Why doesn't Allah punish us for what we say?" Hell will suffice for them, where they will burn. And what a bad destination!
O you who have believed! When you hold secret conversations, do not consult with each other to sin, transgress and disobey the Messenger, but consult in kindness and piety. And fear Allah to whom you will be gathered.
The secret conversation is only the Devil's [work] to grieve those who have believed. But he cannot harm them in any way without Allah's permission. And it is in Allah that the believers must place their trust.
O you who have believed! When you are told, "Make room [for others] in the assemblies," then make room. Allah will give you a place (in Paradise). And when you are told to stand up, stand up. Allah will exalt in degrees those of you who believe and those who have received knowledge. Allah is Knower of what you do.
O you who have believed! When you have a confidential interview with the Messenger, precede your conversation with alms, for this is better for you and purer. But if you cannot find the means then Allah is Forgiving and Most Merciful!
Are you afraid of preceding your interview with alms? But if you have not done so and Allah has accepted your repentance, then perform Salah, pay Zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is Knower of what you do.
Have you not seen those who have taken as allies people against whom Allah has been angry? They are neither of you nor of theirs; and they swear falsely, even though they know.
Allah has prepared a harsh punishment for them. What they were doing then was very bad.
Taking their oaths as shields, they obstruct the path of Allah. They will therefore have a degrading punishment.
Neither their property nor their children will be of any use to them against Allah's [punishment]. These are the people of the Fire where they will dwell forever.
On the day when Allah resurrects them all, they will swear to Him as they swear to you, thinking that they are relying on something solid. But they are the liars.
The Devil dominated them and made them forget the remembrance of Allah. These are the Devil's party and it is the Devil's party that are certainly the losers.
Those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be among the most humiliated.
Allah has commanded: "Assuredly, I and My Messengers will triumph." Verily, Allah is Mighty and Mighty.
You will not find any among the people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, who take as friends those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, be they their fathers, sons, brothers, or the people of their tribe. He has prescribed faith in their hearts and He has helped them with His help. He will bring them into Gardens under which streams flow, where they will dwell forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. These are the party of Allah. The party of Allah is the party of those who succeed.
What is in the heavens and what is on earth glorifies Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
It was He who expelled from their homes those among the People of the Book who did not believe, during the first exodus. You did not think that they would leave, and they thought that in truth their fortresses would defend them against Allah. But Allah came to them through where they did not expect, and brought terror into their hearts. They demolished their homes with their own hands, as well as with the hands of believers. Learn a lesson from this, O you who are endowed with clairvoyance.
And if Allah had not prescribed expatriation against them, He would certainly have punished them here on earth; and in the Hereafter they will have the punishment of fire.
This is because they have risen up against Allah and His Messenger. And whoever stands against Allah... so, truly Allah is harsh in punishment.
Every palm tree that you cut down or left standing on its roots, it is with Allah's permission and so that He may cover the wicked with shame.
The booty from their possessions, which Allah gave to His Messenger without a fight, you did not hire horses or camels; but Allah gives His Messengers dominion over whomever He wills, and Allah is Omnipotent.
The spoils of the people of the cities, which Allah bestowed on His Messenger without a fight, belong to Allah, the Messenger, the next of kin, the orphans, the poor, and the traveler in distress, so that it may not circulate among the rich among you alone. Take what the Messenger gives you; and what he forbids you, abstain from it; and fear Allah because Allah is harsh in punishment.
[It also belongs] to the needy emigrants who were expelled from their homes and possessions, while they were seeking a grace and pleasure from Allah, and helping Allah and His Messenger. These are the truthful ones.
It [also belongs] to those who before them settled in the land and in the faith, who love those who migrate to them, and feel in their hearts no envy for what [these immigrants] have received, and who prefer [them] to themselves, even if there is a shortage among them. Whoever guards himself against his own avarice, these are the ones who succeed.
And [it also belongs] to those who came after them, saying, "Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who went before us in the faith; and do not put in our hearts any resentment for those who have believed. Lord, You are Compassion and Most Merciful."
Have you not seen the hypocrites say to their brethren who have disbelieved among the People of the Book: "If you are cast out, we will certainly go with you, and we will never obey anyone against you; and if you are attacked, we will certainly help you." And Allah testifies that they are liars.
If they are driven out, they will not go with them; and if they are attacked, they will not help them; and even if they went to their aid, they would surely turn their backs; then they will not be helped.
You strike more terror into their hearts than Allah. It's because they're people who don't understand.
All of them will fight you only entrenched in fortified cities or from behind walls. Their internal dissensions are extreme. You would think they were united, but their hearts were divided. It is because they are people who do not reason.
They are like those who, a short time before them, tasted the consequence of their behavior and they will have a painful punishment;
they are like the Devil when he says to man, "Be unbelieving." Then when he disbelieved, he said: "I disown you because I fear Allah, the Lord of the Universe."
It was their destiny to both be in the Fire to dwell there forever. Such is the retribution of the unjust.
O you who have believed! Fear Allah. Let each soul see what it has put forward for tomorrow. And fear Allah, for Allah is Knower of what you do.
And do not be like those who have forgotten Allah; [Allah] then made them forget their own persons; these are the perverts.
The people of Fire and the people of Paradise will not be equal. The people of Paradise are the winners.
If We had sent this Qur'an down a mountain, you would have seen it humble itself and split for fear of Allah. And these parables We quote to the people so that they may think.
He is Allah. There is no god but Him, the Knower of the Invisible as well as the visible. He is the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
It is Allah. No god but Him; The Sovereign, the Pure, the Soothing, the Reassuring, the Predominant, the Almighty, the Constraining, the Proud. Glory be to Allah! He transcends what they associate with Him.
He is Allah, the Creator, the One who gives a beginning to all things, the Formator. To Him are the most beautiful names. All that is in heaven and earth glorifies Him. And He is the Mighty, the Wise.
O you who have believed! Do not take My enemy and yours as your allies, offering them friendship, when they have denied what has come to you of the truth. They expel the Messenger and you because you believe in Allah your Lord. If you have gone out to wrestle in My way and to seek My pleasure, will you secretly show them friendship, when I know perfectly well what you hide and what you divulge? And whoever of you does this strays from the righteousness of the path.
If they dominate you, they will be enemies to you and will stretch out their hands and tongues to you in evil; and they would like you to become disbelievers.
Neither your relatives nor your children will be of any use to you on the Day of Resurrection, He [Allah] will decide between you, and Allah is Clear-sighted about what you do.
Verily, you had a fine example in Abraham and those who were with him, when they said to their people, "We disavow you and what you worship besides Allah. We deny you. Between you and us, enmity and hatred are forever declared until you believe in Allah alone." Except for Abraham's words to his father: "I will indeed beg forgiveness [from Allah] on your behalf, although I can do nothing for you with Allah." "Lord, it is in You that we put our trust and to You we return [repentant]. And to You is Becoming.
Lord, do not make us a temptation to those who have disbelieved; and forgive us, Lord, for You are the Mighty, the Wise."
You have indeed had in them a fine example [to follow], for one who hopes in Allah and in the Last Day; but whoever turns away... then Allah is sufficient in Himself and is worthy of praise.
It may be that Allah establishes friendship between you and those of them whose enemies you have been. And Allah is Omnipotent and Allah is Forgiving and Most Merciful.
Allah does not forbid you to be kind and fair to those who did not fight you for the sake of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. For Allah loves the just.
Allah only forbids you to take as allies those who fought you for the sake of religion, who were driven out of your homes, and who helped in your expulsion. And those who take them as allies are the unjust.
O you who have believed! When the believing women come to you as emigrants, try them; Allah knows their faith best; If you see that they are believers, do not send them back to the disbelievers. They are not lawful [as wives] for them, nor are they lawful [as husbands] for them. And give them back what they have spent (as mahr). You will not be hurt by marrying them when you have given them their mahr. And do not keep marital ties with the disbelievers. Claim what you have spent, and let (the disbelievers) also claim what they have spent. This is the judgment of Allah by which He judges between you, and Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
And if any of your wives escape to the disbelievers, and you retaliate, give back to those whose wives have left as much as they spent. Fear Allah in whom you believe.
O Prophet! When the believing women come to swear allegiance to you, and swear that they will not associate anything with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit adultery, that they will not kill their own children, that they will not commit any infamy with their hands or feet, and that they will not disobey what is proper,  then take their oath of allegiance, and beg Allah for forgiveness for them. Verily, Allah is Forgiving and Most Merciful.
O you who have believed! Do not take as allies people against whom Allah is angry and who despair of the Hereafter, just as the disbelievers despair of the people of the tombs.
What is in the heavens and what is on earth glorifies Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
O you who have believed! Why do you say what you don't do?
It is a great abomination in the sight of Allah to say what you do not do.
Allah loves those who fight in His way in close ranks, like a strong building.
And when Moses said to his people, "O my people! Why do you mistreat me when you know that I am truly the Messenger of Allah [sent] to you?" Then when they deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate, for Allah does not guide the wicked.
And when Jesus son of Mary said: "O Children of Israel, I am truly the Messenger of Allah [sent] to you, confirming what in the Torah is prior to me, and heralding a Messenger to come after me, whose name will be "Ahmad". Then when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, "This is manifest magic."
And who is more unjust than the one who invents a lie against Allah, when he is called to Islam? And Allah does not guide unrighteous people.
They want to extinguish the light of Allah from their mouths, while Allah will complete His light in spite of the dislike of the disbelievers.
It is He who sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, to place it above all other religions, in spite of the aversion of the associates.
O you who have believed! shall I point out to you a trade that will save you from a painful punishment?
You believe in Allah and His Messenger and you fight with your property and your people in the cause of Allah, and it is much better for you, if you knew!
He will forgive you your sins, and bring you into the Gardens under which the streams flow, and into pleasant dwellings in the Gardens of Eden. This is the huge success
and He will grant you other things that you like: help from Allah and a coming victory. And proclaims the good news to believers.
O you who have believed! Be the allies of Allah, as Jesus son of Mary said to the apostles: "Who are my allies (for the cause) of Allah?" - The apostles said: "We are the allies of Allah". A group of the Children of Israel believed, while a group denied. So we helped those who believed against their enemy, and they triumphed.
What is in the heavens and what is on earth glorifies Allah, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Mighty, the Wise.
It is He who sent to the people without a Book (the Arabs) a Messenger of their own who recites His verses to them, purifies them and teaches them the Book and the Wisdom, although they were previously in an obvious error,
as well as others among those who have not yet joined them. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
This is the grace of Allah that He gives to whomever He wills. And Allah is the Possessor of great grace.
Those who have been entrusted with the Torah but have not applied it are like a donkey carrying books. What a bad example is that of those who call the verses of Allah lies, and Allah does not guide unrighteous people.
Say: "O you who practice Judaism! If you claim to be Allah's beloved to the exclusion of others, then wish for death, if you are truthful."
But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have prepared. Allah, however, knows well the wrongdoers.
Say: "The death you are fleeing from will certainly meet you. Then you will be brought back to the One who knows perfectly the Invisible world and the visible world and who will then inform you of what you were doing."
O you who have believed! When one calls for the Friday prayer, hasten to the invocation of Allah and leave all business. This is much better for you, if you knew!
Then when the Salat is finished, scatter yourselves on the earth and seek [some effect] of Allah's grace, and invoke Allah much so that you may succeed.
When they see some commerce or amusement, they scatter there and leave you standing. Say: "What is with Allah is far better than entertainment and commerce, and Allah is the best of providers."
When the hypocrites come to you, they say: "We testify that you are indeed the Messenger of Allah" Allah knows that you are truly His Messenger; and Allah testifies that the hypocrites are certainly liars.
They take their oaths as a shield and obstruct the path of Allah. What bad things they did!
It is because in truth they believed, and then rejected the faith. Their hearts, therefore, have been sealed, so that they understand nothing.
And when you see them, their bodies amaze you; and if they speak, you listen to their word. They are like logs leaning against walls and they think that every cry is directed at them. The enemy is them. Take heed of this. May Allah destroy them! As they are diverted (from the right path).
And when it is said to them, "Come, may the Messenger of Allah beg forgiveness for you," they turn their heads, and you see them turn away while they puff themselves up with pride.
It is all the same whether you beg forgiveness for them or not: Allah will never forgive them, for Allah does not guide evil people.
They are the ones who say: "Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah, so that they may be scattered." And to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand.
They say: "If we return to Madinah, the most powerful will certainly bring out the humblest." And it is to Allah that the power is and to His Messenger and to the believers. But the hypocrites don't know this.
O you who have believed! Let neither your property nor your children distract you from the remembrance of Allah. And anybody who does that... then those will be the losers.
And spend of what We have bestowed upon you before death comes to one of you and he then says, "Lord! if only You would grant me a short delay: I would give alms and be among the good."
Allah, however, never gives a delay to a soul whose term has come. And Allah is Fully Aware of what you do.
What is in the heavens and what is on the earth glorifies Allah. To Him is the kingdom and to Him are the praises. And He is Omnipotent.
He is the One who created you. Among you there are disbelievers and believers. Allah is watching perfectly what you do.
He created the heavens and the earth in all truth and gave you your form and what a beautiful form He gave you! And to Him is becoming.
He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you hide as well as what you disclose. And Allah knows well the contents of the breasts.
Has it not reached you, the news of those who previously disbelieved and who tasted the evil consequence of their act; they will also have a painful punishment.
This is because their messengers came to them with clear proofs, and they said, "Will men guide us?" Then they disbelieved and turned away, and Allah did without them, and Allah is sufficient for Himself and is worthy of praise.
Those who have disbelieved say that they will not be resurrected. Say: "Yes! By my Lord! You will most certainly be resurrected; then you will certainly be informed of what you were doing. And this is easy for Allah."
Believe in Allah and His Messenger and in the Light [the Qur'an] that We have sent down. And Allah is Fully Aware of what you do.
The day He gathers you together for the Day of Gathering, it will be the day of great loss. And whoever believes in Allah and does good deeds, He will blot out his evil deeds and bring him into gardens under which flow streams where they will dwell forever. This is a huge success!
And those who have disbelieved and called Our verses lies, these are the people of the Fire where they will dwell forever. And what a bad destination!
No evil befalls [man] except by the permission of Allah. And whoever believes in Allah, [Allah] guides his heart. Allah is All-Knowing.
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and if you turn away... it is incumbent upon Our Messenger only to convey (His message) in plain English.
Allah no god but Him! And it is to Allah that the believers [must] entrust.
O you who have believed, you have an enemy of your wives and children [a temptation]. Take heed, then. But if you excuse [them], pass over [their] faults and forgive [them], know that Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Your possessions and your children are only a temptation, while with Allah is a huge reward.
Fear Allah, so as much as you can, listen, obey and give largesse. It will be good for you. And whoever has been protected from his own greed... these are the ones who succeed.
If you make a sincere loan to Allah, He will multiply it for you and forgive you. Allah, however, is Most Grateful and Forgiving.
He is the Knower of the Invisible and Visible world, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.
O Prophet! When you repudiate women, divorce them according to their prescribed waiting period; and count the period; and fear Allah your Lord. Do not take them out of their houses, nor let them leave them, unless they have committed proven turpitude. These are the laws of Allah. Whoever transgresses the laws of Allah, however, is wronging himself. You don't know if by then Allah will not raise up something new!
Then, when they reach the prescribed term, restrain them in a proper manner, or separate yourself from them in a proper manner; and take two upright men from among you as witnesses. And fulfill your testimony to Allah. This is what one who believes in Allah and the Last Day is exhorted to do. And whoever fears Allah, He will give him a favorable outcome,
and will bestow upon him His gifts in ways that he did not rely on. And whoever puts his trust in Allah, He [Allah] is sufficient for him. Allah attains what He sets Himself for, and Allah has assigned a measure to everything.
If you have doubts about your wives who are no longer expecting to have a period, their waiting period is three months. The same goes for those who do not yet have a period. And as for those who are pregnant, their waiting period will end when they give birth. Whoever fears Allah, however, He makes things easier for him.
This is the command of Allah that He has sent down to you. Whoever fears Allah, however, He will erase his sins and give him a great reward.
And let these women live where you live, and according to your means. And don't try to harm them by forcing them to live in cramped conditions. And if they are pregnant, provide for them until they have given birth. Then, if they nurse [the child born] of you, give them their wages. And consult [on this matter] in a proper way. And if you encounter mutual difficulties, then another will breastfeed for him.
Let him who is well-to-do spend his fortune; and let him whose possessions are restricted spend according to what Allah has granted him. Allah imposes on no one except according to what He has given him, and Allah will make ease succeed to embarrassment.
How many cities have insolently refused the command of their Lord and His messengers! We demanded of them an account of it with severity, and punished them with an unheard-of punishment.
So they tasted the consequence of their behavior. And the end result of their actions was [their] perdition.
Allah has prepared a harsh punishment for them. Fear Allah, therefore, O you who are endowed with understanding, you who have faith. Verily, Allah has sent down a reminder to you,
a Messenger who recites to you the verses of Allah as clear proofs, in order to bring out those who believe and do good deeds from darkness to light. And whoever believes in Allah and does good, He brings him into the Gardens under which the streams flow, to dwell there forever. Allah has given him a beautiful attribution.
Allah who created seven heavens and as many earths. Between them [His] commandment descends, so that you may know that Allah is indeed Omnipotent and that Allah has embraced all things of [His] knowledge.
O Prophet! Why, in seeking the pleasure of your wives, do you forbid yourself what Allah has made lawful for you? And Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allah has commanded you to free yourself from your oaths. Allah is your Master; and He is the All-Knowing, the Wise.
When the Prophet confided a secret to one of his wives and she had divulged it and Allah had informed him of it, he made known part of it and passed over part of it. Then, when he had informed her of this, she said, "Who gave you news?" He said, "It is the All-Knowing, the All-Knowing, who has warned me."
If you repent to Allah, it is because your hearts have failed. But if you support each other against the Prophet, then his allies will be Allah, Gabriel, and the righteous among the believers, and the angels will also support [him].
If He divorces you, His Lord may give Him better wives than you, Muslims, believers, obedient, repentant, worshippers, fasting, already married or virgins.
O you who have believed! Preserve your persons and your families from a Fire whose fuel will be people and stones, watched over by rude, harsh angels, never disobeying Allah in what He commands them, and doing strictly as they are commanded.
O you who have disbelieved! Don't apologize today. You will only be rewarded according to what you worked.
O you who have believed! Repent to Allah with sincere repentance. It may be that your Lord will blot out your sins and bring you into the Gardens under which the streams flow, on the Day when Allah will spare the Prophet and those who believe with him from ignominy. Their light will run before them and at their right hand; they will say, "Lord, forgive us our light and forgive us. for you are omnipotent."
O Prophet! Lead the fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh towards them. Their refuge will be Hell, and what a bad destination!
Allah has quoted as a parable for those who disbelieved the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under the authority of two righteous of Our servants. Both betrayed them and they were of no help to [these two women] in the eyes of Allah. And it was said to them, "Enter into the Fire, both of you, with those who enter it."
and Allah has quoted Pharaoh's wife as a parable for those who believe, when she says: "Lord, build me a house with You in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his work; and save me from unjust people."
Similarly, Mary, the daughter of Imran who had preserved her virginity; We then breathed into it Our Spirit. She had declared the words of her Lord as well as His Books to be true: she was among the devoted.
Blessed be He in whose hand is the kingdom, and He is Omnipotent.
The One who created death and life in order to test you (and to know) which of you is the best at work, and He is the Mighty, the Forgiver.
He who created seven heavens superimposed without you seeing any disproportion in the creation of the Most Merciful. Bring [her back] to her. Do you see any breach in it?
Then turn your gaze twice: the look will come back to you humiliated and frustrated.
We have indeed beautified the nearest heaven with lamps [of the stars] which We have made into projectiles to stone the devils, and We have prepared for them the punishment of the Furnace.
Those who have disbelieved in their Lord will have the punishment of Hell. And what a bad destination!
When they are thrown into it, they will hear a groan in it, while it bubbles.
He is very far from bursting out of rage. Whenever a group is thrown into it, its guards ask them: "What! Has not a warner come to you?"
They said, "Yes! a warner came to us, but we cried out and said, 'Allah has not sent anything down: you are only in a great error.'
And they said, "If we had listened or reasoned, we would not have been among the people of the Furnace."
They have acknowledged their sin. May the people of the Furnace be annihilated forever.
Those who fear their Lord even though they have never seen Him will have forgiveness and a great reward.
Whether you hide your word or divulge it, He knows the contents of the breasts well.
Does He not know what He has created when He is the Compassionate, the Perfected Knower?
It is He who has subdued the earth to you: therefore go through its great expanses. Eat of what He provides for you. To Him is the Resurrection.
Are you safe from Him who is in heaven burying you in the earth? And now she trembles!
Or are you safe from Him in heaven sending a hurricane of stones against you? In this way you will know what My warning was.
Indeed, those before them had cried lies. What was My reprobation then!
Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading and folding their wings in turn? Only the Most Merciful sustains them. For He is over all things, Clairvoyant.
Who is there who would constitute for you an army [capable] of helping you, apart from the Most Merciful? In truth, the disbelievers are in complete illusion.
Or who is the one who will give you your sustenance if He stops providing His allocation? But they persist in their insolence and repulsion.
So who is better guided? The one who walks face down or the one who walks upright on a straight path.
Say: "He created you and gave you hearing, eyes and hearts." But you're rarely grateful!
Say: "It is He who has poured you out on the earth, and to Him you will be gathered."
And they say, "When will this promise be made, if you are truthful?"
Say: "Allah alone has knowledge. And I'm just a clear warner."
Then, when they see (the punishment) at close quarters, the faces of those who have disbelieved will be afflicted. And they will be told, "This is what you have been asking for."
Say: "What do you think? May Allah destroy me and those who are with me, or have mercy on us, who will protect the disbelievers from painful punishment?"
Say: "He is the Most Merciful. We believe in Him and it is in Him that we place our trust. You will soon know who is in an obvious error."
Say: "What do you think? If your water were absorbed deep in the earth, who would bring you spring water?"
Nûn. By the pen and what they write!
You (Muhammad) are not, by the grace of your Lord, a possessed person.
And there will certainly be for you a reward that will never be interrupted.
And you are certainly of eminent morality.
You'll see and they'll see
Who among you has lost your mind.
It is your Lord who knows best those who stray from His path, and He knows better those who walk the right way.
Do not obey those who cry lies,
They would like you to compromise with them so that they will compromise with you.
And obey no great swearer, contemptible,
great slanderer, great peddler of backbiting,
great hindrance of good, transgressor, great sinner,
hard-hearted, and on top of that a bastard.
Even if he is endowed with wealth and (many) children.
When Our verses are recited to him, he says, "Tales of the ancients."
We will mark it on the muzzle [nose].
We have tried them as We have tried the owners of the orchard who had sworn to harvest them in the morning,
without saying: "Allah willing".
A calamity from your Lord fell upon them while they were sleeping,
and in the morning it was as if everything had been razed to the ground.
The next morning they called to one another:
"Go to your field early if you want to harvest it."
So they went, while talking to each other in a low voice:
"Don't let any poor people enter today."
They set out early determined to use avarice [towards the poor], convinced that it was in their power.
Then, when they saw it [the garden], they said, "Truly, we have lost our way.
Or rather we are frustrated."
The most righteous of them said: "Did I not say to you, 'If only you have given glory to Allah?'"
They said, "Glory to our Lord! Yes, we have been unjust."
Then they addressed each other, reproaching each other.
They said, "Woe to us! We have been rebels.
We wish that our Lord would replace it for us with something better. We want to get closer to our Lord."
Such was the punishment; and the punishment of the Hereafter is even greater, if only they knew!
The pious will have the Gardens of Delight with their Lord.
Will We treat those who are subject to Allah in the manner of criminals?
What have you got? How do you judge?
Or do you have a Book in which you learn
that in truth you will obtain all that you desire?
Or have you obtained from Us oaths valid until the Day of Resurrection, binding Us to give you what you decide?
Ask them who among them is responsible for this?
Or do they have partners? Well, let them bring their associates if they are truthful!
The day when they will face the horrors [of the Judgment] and will be called to prostration, but they will not be able to.
Their eyes will be lowered, and degradation will cover them. Now they were called to prostration at the time when they were safe and sound...
Leave Me therefore with anyone who calls this speech a lie; We will gradually lead them through where they don't know!
And I give them a delay, for My stratagem is safe!
Or do you ask them for a salary, thus burdening them with a heavy debt?
Or do they know the Unknowable and it is from there that they write [their lies]?
Endure with patience the sentence of your Lord, and do not be like the man with the fish [Jonah] who called (Allah) in his great anguish.
If a blessing of his Lord had not come to him, he would have been cast back in despised land on a desert land,
Then his Lord elected him and named him among the good.
Those who disbelieve are very close to piercing you with their eyes, when they hear the Qur'an, they say: "He is indeed mad!"
And this is only a Reminder, addressed to the worlds!
The inevitable [the Hour that shows the truth]
What is the inevitable?
And who will tell you what the inevitable is?
The Thamûd and the 'Aad had treated the cataclysm as a lie.
As for the Thamud, they were destroyed by the excessively loud [noise].
And as for the 'Aad, they were destroyed by a roaring and furious wind
that [Allah] unleashed against them for seven consecutive nights and eight consecutive days; then you saw the people knocked to the ground like hollowed-out palm stumps.
Do you see the slightest vestige of it?
Pharaoh and those who lived before him, as well as the overthrown cities, committed sins.
They disobeyed the Messenger of their Lord. The latter, therefore, seized them in an irresistible manner.
It was We who, when the water overflowed, charged you on the Ark
in order to make it a reminder for you that every faithful ear preserves.
Then, when with a single breath one blows into the Trunk,
and that the earth and the mountains will be lifted and then compacted at one blow;
on that day then, the Event will take place,
and the sky will split and be fragile on that day.
And on his sides [shall stand] the angels, while eight on that day shall carry over them the throne of thy Lord.
On that day you will be exposed; and nothing of you will be hidden.
As for the one who has been given the Book in his right hand, he will say: "Here! Read my book.
I was sure to find what I was looking for."
He will enjoy a pleasant life:
in a high-ranking garden
whose fruits are within reach.
"Eat and drink pleasantly for what you have advanced in the past days."
As for the one who has been given the Book in his left hand, he will say: "Alas for me! I wish they hadn't given me my book,
and not having known my account...
Alas, how I wish [my first death] had been the final one.
My fortune has been of no use to me.
My authority has been annihilated and has left me!"
"Seize it! Then, put a shackle on him;
then burn it in the Furnace;
then bind him with a chain of seventy cubits,
for he did not believe in Allah, the Most Great.
and did not encourage them to feed the poor.
He has no warm friend for him here today, [to protect him].
nor any other food than pus,
that only the guilty will eat."
Of course not... I swear by what you see,
as well as by what you do not see,
that this [the Qur'an] is the word of a noble Messenger,
and that it is not the word of a poet; but you believe very little,
nor the word of a soothsayer, but you remember very little.
It is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe.
And if he had forged some words which they had attributed to Us,
We would have grasped it with our right hand,
Then We would have cut off his aorta.
And none of you could have served as a bulwark for it.
It is indeed a reminder to the pious.
And We know that there are among you who call him a liar;
But verily, it will be a matter of regret to the disbelievers,
this is the real certainty.
Glorify therefore the name of your Lord, the Most Great!
One claimant called for an unavoidable punishment,
for the disbelievers, whom no one could reject,
and which comes from Allah, the Lord of the ways of ascent.
The Angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in a day of fifty thousand years.
Bear with a good patience.
They see it (the punishment) far away,
when We see him very near,
the day when the sky will be like molten metal
and the mountains like wool,
where no devoted friend will inquire about a friend,
although they see each other. The criminal would like to be able to redeem himself from the punishment of this day, by betraying his children,
his partner, his brother,
even his clan that gave him asylum,
and everything that is on earth, everything that could save him.
But nothing [will save him]. [Hell] is an inferno
brutally tearing the skin off the skull.
He will call the one who turned his back and went away,
amassed and hoarded.
Yes, man was created unstable [very restless];
when misfortune befalls him, he is cast down;
and when happiness touches him, he is a great refuser.
Except those who practice Salat
who are assiduous in their salats,
and to the property of which there is a definite right [Zakat]
for the beggar and the disinherited;
and who declare the Day of Retribution to be true,
and those who fear the punishment of their Lord
for truly there is no insurance against the punishment of their Lord;
and who maintain themselves in chastity
and have relations only with their wives or the slaves they own, because in that case they are not to blame,
but those who seek [their pleasure] outside of this, are transgressors;
and who keep the deposits entrusted to them, and scrupulously respect their commitments;
and who testify to the strict truth,
and who are regular in their Salat.
These will be honored in Gardens.
What have those who have disbelieved to run to you with outstretched necks,
from the right and the left, [coming] in bands?
Does each of them covet to be allowed to enter the Garden of Earthly Delights?
Of course not! We created them from what they know.
No... I swear by the Lord of the Rising and Setting That We are Capable
to replace them with better than them, and no one can prevent us from doing so.
Let them sink into their disbelief and enjoy themselves until they meet their day that was threatened against them.
on the day when they come out of the graves, swift as if they were running towards standing stones;
their eyes will be lowered, degradation will cover them. This is the day they were threatened with!
We sent Noah to his people: "Warn your people before a painful punishment comes to them."
He said to them, "O my people, I am truly a clear warner to you,
Worship Allah, fear Him, and obey me,
so that He will forgive you your sins and give you a delay until a fixed time. But when the time comes for Allah, it cannot be postponed if you knew."
He said, "Lord! I have called my people, night and day.
But my call only increased their flight.
And every time I called them to forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears. wrapped themselves in their clothes, were stubborn and extremely proud.
Then I called them openly.
Then I made public proclamations to them, and confidences in secret.
So I said, "Pray for forgiveness from your Lord, for He is a great Forgiver,
so that He may send you abundant rains from heaven,
and that He will grant you many possessions and children, and give you gardens and give you rivers.
What is the matter with you not worshipping Allah as it should be,
when He created you in successive phases?
Have you not seen how Allah created seven superimposed heavens
and made the moon a light and the sun a lamp?
And it is Allah who has made you grow from the earth like plants,
then He will make you return to it and bring you out of it in truth.
And it is Allah who has made you a carpet out of the earth,
so that you may travel by its spacious ways."
Noah said, "Lord, they disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children only increased his loss.
They hatched a huge stratagem,
and they said, "Never forsake your gods and never forsake Wadd, Suwa, Yaghhu, Ya'uk, and Nasr'.
They [the idols] have already led many astray. Do not (Lord) make the unrighteous grow except in error.
Because of their sins, they were drowned, and then they were brought into the Fire, and they did not find any helpers except Allah."
And Noah said, "Lord, leave no unfaithful on earth.
If You leave them [alive], they will lead Your servants astray and beget only unfaithful sinners.
Lord! Forgive me, both my father and mother, and the one who enters my believing house, and the believers; and make the unrighteous grow only in perdition."
Say: "It has been revealed to me that a group of jinn listened and said, 'We have heard a wonderful reading,
who guides to righteousness. We believed in it, and we will never associate anyone with our Lord.
Verily, our Lord - may His greatness be exalted - has given Himself neither companion nor child!
Our fool [Iblis] used to say extravagances against Allah.
And we thought that neither humans nor jinn could ever tell a lie against Allah.
However, there were males among humans who sought protection from males among the jinn, but this only increased their distress.
And they thought as you thought that Allah would never resurrect anyone.
We had brushed against the sky and found it full of a strong guard and cars.
We sat down to listen. But whoever listens now, finds a speedster on the lookout against him.
We do not know whether they want to harm the inhabitants of the earth or whether their Lord wants to put them on the right path.
There are among us some who are virtuous and some who are less so: we were divided into different sects.
We believed that we could never reduce Allah to impotence on earth, and that we could never reduce Him to impotence by fleeing.
And when we heard the guide [the Qur'an], we believed it, and whoever believes in his Lord then fears neither lessening of reward nor oppression.
There are Muslims among us, and there are the unrighteous [who have deviated]. And those who converted to Islam are those who sought righteousness.
And as for the unjust, they will form the fuel of Hell.
And if they had kept the right direction, We would have watered them, indeed with abundant water,
in order to test them there. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He leads him to an ever-increasing chastisement.
The mosques are dedicated to Allah, so do not call upon anyone with Allah.
And when the servant of Allah stood up to call upon Him, they almost rushed upon him en masse.
Say: "I call only on my Lord and do not associate anyone with Him."
Say: "I have no means to harm you, nor to put you on the right path."
Say: "Truly, no one will be able to protect me from Allah; and I will never find a refuge apart from Him.
[I can only convey] communication and messages from Allah. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger will have the fire of Hell to dwell there forever.
Then, when they see what they were threatened with, they will know which ones have the weakest help and which are the fewest.
Say: "I do not know whether what you are threatened with is near, or whether my Lord is going to set a time for it.
[It is He] who knows the mystery. He does not reveal His mystery to anyone,
except to him whom He accepts as a Messenger and whom He precedes and follows with vigilant guardians,
so that He may know whether they have conveyed the messages of their Lord. He identifies (of His knowledge) what is with them, and counts everything exactly.
O you, the wrapped [in your garments]!
Get up [to pray], all night long, except for a small part;
His half, or a little less;
or a little more. And recites the Koran, slowly and clearly.
We are going to reveal some heavy (very important) words to you.
Prayer at night is more effective and more conducive to recitation.
During the day you have to go about long occupations.
And remember the name of your Lord and consecrate yourself totally to Him,
the Lord of the East and the Sunset. There is no god but Him. Take Him therefore as your Protector.
And endure what they say; and depart from them in a proper manner.
And leave me with those who cry falsehood and live in ease; and give them a short respite:
We have [for them] heavy chains and Hell,
and food to suffocate, and painful punishment.
The day when the earth and the mountains tremble, while the mountains become like a scattered sand dune.
We have sent you a Messenger to be a witness against you, just as We sent a Messenger to Pharaoh.
Pharaoh then disobeyed the Messenger. We therefore grasped it rudely.
How will you preserve yourself, if you disbelieve, from a day that will make children like old men with white hair?
[and] during which the sky will split. His promise will undoubtedly be fulfilled.
This is a reminder. Let him who wants to take a way [leading] to his Lord.
Your Lord knows, verily, that you (Muhammad) stand less than two-thirds of the night, or his half, or his third. As well as some of those who are with you. Allah determines night and day. He knows that you will never be able to spend the whole night in prayer. He has been indulgent to you. So recite what is possible from the Qur'an. He knows that there will be among you those who are sick, and others who will travel on earth seeking the grace of Allah, and still others who will fight in the cause of Allah. Recite therefore what is possible for you. Perform Salah, pay Zakat, and make a sincere loan to Allah. Whatever you prepare for yourself, you will find it with Allah, who is better and greater in reward. And beg Allah's forgiveness. For Allah is Forgiving and Most Merciful.
O you (Muhammad)! Dressed him in a cloak!
Get up and warn.
And of your Lord, praise greatness.
And your garments, purify them.
And from all sin, depart from it.
And don't give in order to receive more.
And for your Lord's sake, endure.
When the Bugle is sounded,
Then that day will be a difficult day,
not easy for the unbelievers.
Leave Me with Him whom I have created alone,
and to whom I have given extensive goods,
and the children who always keep him company,
for whom also I have smoothed out all difficulties
However, he covets [Me] that I give him more.
Not at all! For he stubbornly denied our verses (the Qur'an).
I'm going to force him to climb a slope.
He thought about it. And he decided.
Let him perish! As he decided!
Once more, let him perish; as he decided!
Then he watched.
And he frowned and hardened his face.
Then he turned his back and puffed himself up with pride
Then he said, "This (the Qur'an) is just learned magic
this is only the word of a human."
I will burn it in the Intense Fire (Saqar).
And who will tell you what Saqar is?
He leaves nothing and spares nothing;
It burns the skin and blackens it.
Nineteen of them are making sure of this.
We have assigned only Angels as guardians of the Fire. However, We have fixed the number only to test the disbelievers, and also so that those to whom the Book has been brought may be convinced, and the faith of those who believe may grow, and those to whom the Book has been brought and the believers may have no doubt. And so that those who have some disease in their hearts, as well as the disbelievers, may say: "What did Allah mean with this parable?" This is how Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. No one knows the armies of your Lord except Him. And that's just a reminder for humans.
No!... By the moon!
And by night when she retires!
And by the dawn when it is uncovered!
[Saqar] is one of the greatest [woes]
A warning, for humans.
For those of you, want to move forward or backward.
Every soul is a hostage to what it has acquired.
Except for the people on the right (the elected officials):
in the Gardens, they will ask themselves
About the criminals:
"What brought you to Saqar?"
They will say: "We were not of those who did Salat,
and we did not feed the poor,
and we associated with those who held futile conversations,
and we treated the Day of Retribution as a lie,
until the obvious truth [death] came to us."
Therefore the intercession of the intercessors will not profit them.
What do they have to turn away from the Rappel?
They are like terrified onagers,
fleeing from a lion.
Each of them would rather have papers all spread out for him.
Ah! No! Rather, they do not fear the hereafter.
Ah! No! This is really a reminder.
Whoever wills, let him remember it.
But they will remember only if Allah wills. It is He who is most worthy of fear; and it is He who holds forgiveness.
No!... I swear by the Day of Resurrection!
But no!, I swear by the soul that never ceases to blame itself.
Does man think that We will never reunite his bones?
Yes, you are! We are able to put the ends of his fingers back in their place.
The man would rather continue to live as a libertine.
He asks: "When will the Day of Resurrection come?"
When the view is dazzled,
and the moon will be eclipsed,
and the sun and the moon shall be united,
the man on that day will say, "Where to flee?"
No! No refuge!
To your Lord will be the return on that day.
The man will be informed on that day of what he has said and what he has put off.
But man will be a discerning witness against himself,
even if he would apologize.
Do not move your tongue to hasten its recitation:
Its gathering (in your heart and its fixation in your memory) is up to Us, as well as the way to recite it.
So when We recite it, follow its recitation.
It will then be up to Us to explain it.
But you rather like ephemeral [life],
and you abandon the hereafter.
On that day, there will be resplendent faces
who will look upon their Lord;
and on that day there will be darkened faces,
who expect to suffer a catastrophe.
Of course not! When [the soul] comes to the collarbones
and they say, "Who is an exorcist?"
and that he [the dying person] is convinced that it is separation (death),
and the leg is entangled at the leg,
it is to your Lord that you will be led on that day."
But he neither believed nor did Salat;
on the other hand, he denied it and turned his back,
then he went to his family, walking with pride.
"Woe to you, woe!"
And woe to you again, woe!
Does man think that he will be left without obligation to observe?
Wasn't he a drop of ejaculated semen?
And then an adhesion Then [Allah] created and formed it harmoniously;
then made them the two elements of the couple: the male and the female?
Is not this one [Allah] able to revive the dead?
Has there been a period of time for man during which he was not even a thing to be mentioned?
For We have created man from a drop of semen mixed [with various components] to put him to the test. [That's why] We did it hearing and seeing.
We have guided him on the path, whether he is grateful or ungrateful
We have prepared for the infidels chains, shackles, and a fiery furnace.
The virtuous will drink from a cup mixed with camphor,
from which the servants of Allah will drink and they will make it flow in abundance.
They fulfill their vows and they dread a day whose evil will spread everywhere.
and offer food, in spite of his love, to the poor, the orphan, and the prisoner,
(saying): "It is for the face of Allah that we feed you: we do not want from you any reward or gratitude.
We fear from our Lord a terrible and catastrophic day."
Therefore Allah will protect them from the evil of that day, and will bring them splendor and joy,
and will reward them for what they have endured, giving them Paradise and silken [garments],
they will be leaning on couches, seeing neither sun nor freezing cold.
Its shadows will cover them closely, and its fruits inclined very low [within reach of their hands].
And silver vessels and crystalline cups shall be circulated among them,
in silver crystal, the contents of which have been skilfully dosed.
And there they will be watered with a cup mixed with ginger,
drawn from it from a spring called Salsabîl.
And among them, there will be eternally young boys. When you see them, you will take them for scattered pearls.
And when you look yonder, you will see a delight and a vast kingdom.
They will wear green satin and brocade clothing. And they will be adorned with silver bracelets. And their Lord will drink them with a very pure drink.
This will be a reward for you, and your effort will be recognized.
Verily, it is We who have sent down the Qur'an to you gradually.
Therefore endure what your Lord has decreed, and obey neither the sinner among them nor the great disbeliever.
And call on the name of your Lord, morning and afternoon;
and prostrate yourself before Him part of the night; and glorify Him for long [hours] during the night.
These people love ephemeral [life] (life on earth) and leave behind a very heavy day [the Day of Judgment].
It is We who have created them and strengthened their constitution. When We will, however, We replace them [easily] with their fellows.
This is a reminder. Let whoever wants to take the path to his Lord!
However, you will not know how to will, unless Allah wills. And Allah is All-Knowing and Wise.
He brings whomever He wants into His mercy. And as for the unrighteous, He has prepared a painful punishment for them.
By those who are sent in bursts,
and blowing in a storm!
And which disperse widely [in all directions].
By those who clearly separate (good and evil),
and issue a recall
as an excuse or a warning!
What is promised to you is inevitable.
When the stars are blotted out,
and the heavens will be split,
and the mountains will be pulverized,
and that the time (for the meeting) of the Messengers has been appointed...
To what day was all this postponed?
On the Day of Decision. [the Judgment]!
And who will tell you what the Day of Decision is?
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
Have we not destroyed the first [generations]?
And did We not have them followed by the last?
This is how We deal with criminals.
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
Have We not created you from vile water?
which We have placed in a safe resting place,
for a known period of time?
We have decreed it so, and We decree [everything] perfectly.
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
Have We not made the earth a place containing them all,
the living as well as the dead?
And have We not firmly placed high mountains there? And have We not watered you with fresh water?
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
Go to what you then called a lie!
Go to a three-branched shadow [smoke of Hell];
that is neither shady nor capable of protecting against the flame;
for [fire] throws forth sparks as voluminous as castles,
and that one would take for yellow camels.
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
This will be the day when they [cannot] speak,
and they will not be allowed to apologize.
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
This is the Day of Judgment, when we will gather you and the elders.
If you have a cunning, then cunning against Me.
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
The stakes will be among shades and springs
As well as fruit according to their desires.
"Eat and drink pleasantly, for what you did."
This is how We reward the beneficent.
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
"Eat and enjoy a little (here below); you are certainly criminals."
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
And when they are told, "Bow down, they don't bow.
Woe, on that day, to those who cried lies.
After this, in what word will they believe?
What do they ask each other about?
On the big news,
about which they differ.
Well, no! They will soon know.
Again, no! They will soon know.
Have We not made the earth a bed?
and (placed) the mountains as stakes?
We have created you as couples,
and designated your sleep for your rest,
and makes the night a garment,
and appointed the day for the affairs of life,
and built over you seven strengthened (heavens),
and have placed a very burning lamp (the sun),
and brings down abundant water from the clouds
to make grains and plants grow by it
and lush gardens.
The Day of Judgment has its appointed end.
On the day when the trumpet is blown, you will come in troops,
and heaven shall be opened and [shall present] gates,
and the mountains will be set in motion and become a mirage.
Hell remains on the lookout,
refuge for transgressors.
They remained there for successive centuries.
They will taste neither freshness nor drink,
Apart from boiling water and pus
as fair reward.
For they did not expect to give an account,
and continually treated as lies, Our verses,
whereas We have numbered all things in writing.
Taste it. We will only increase the punishment for you!
For the stakes, it will be a success:
gardens and vineyards,
and (beautiful) with rounded breasts, of equal youth,
and overflowing cuts.
They will hear no trivialities or lies.
As a reward from your Lord and as an abundant gift
of the Lord of heaven and earth and of what exists between them, the Most Merciful; they dare not speak to Him.
On the day when the Spirit and the Angels stand in ranks, no one will be able to speak, except the one to whom the Most Merciful has granted permission, and who will speak the truth.
That day is inevitable. Whoever wants to take refuge with his Lord, then.
We have warned you of a punishment at hand, the day when man will see what his two hands have prepared; and the infidel will say, "Alas for me! How I would have liked to be nothing but dust."
By those who violently tear up!
And by those who gather with meekness!
And by those who sail freely,
then rush forward at full speed,
and settle affairs!
The Day [the Earth] Trembles [at the First Sound of the Bugle]
immediately followed by the second.
On that day there will be hearts that will be shaken with fear,
and their eyes will be lowered.
They say, "What! Shall we be brought back to our first life,
when we are rotten bones?"
They say: "Then it will be a ruinous return!"
There will be only a summons,
and behold, they will be on the earth.
Has the account of Moses come to you?
When his Lord called him in Towâ, the sanctified valley:
"Go to Pharaoh. Really, he rebelled!"
Then say to him, "Would you purify yourself?
and that I will guide you to your Lord that you may fear Him?"
He showed him the great miracle.
But he called it a lie and disobeyed;
Then he turned his back, went away hastily,
gathered [the people] together and made a proclamation to them,
and said, "I am your Lord, the Most High."
Then Allah seizes him with the exemplary punishment of the Hereafter and of this world.
This is certainly a matter for reflection for the fearful.
Are you harder to create? or the sky, which He has built?
He raised his vault very high, then ordered it perfectly;
He darkened his night and made his day shine.
And as for the earth, after that, He spread it out:
He has brought forth from it his water and his pasture,
and as for the mountains, He has anchored them,
for your enjoyment, you and your cattle.
Then when the great cataclysm comes,
the day when man will remember what he has striven for,
Hell will be fully visible to the one who looks...
As for the one who has exceeded the limits
and will have preferred the present life,
then, Hell will be his refuge...
And for him who has dreaded to appear before his Lord, and preserved his soul from the passion,
Paradise will then be his refuge.
They ask you about the Hour, "When is it going to drop anchor?"
What knowledge have you to tell them?
Its end is known only to your Lord.
You are only the warner of him who fears it.
The day they see her, it will seem to them that they have stayed only one evening or one morning.
He frowned, and turned away
because the blind man has come to him.
Who says to you, 'Perhaps he is seeking to purify himself?'
or to remember so that the recall benefits him?
As for the one who delights in his self-sufficiency (for his wealth)
you go eagerly to meet him.
But what does it matter to you that it does not purify itself?"
And as for him who comes to you with eagerness
while having fear,
you don't care.
Don't do that anymore! Really this is a reminder –
Whoever wants to remember it -
recorded in honored sheets,
elevated, purified,
In the hands of ambassadors
noble, obedient.
May man perish! How ungrateful he is!
What did [Allah] create it from?
From a drop of semen, He creates it and determines (its fate):
then He makes his way easier;
then He kills him and puts him in the tomb;
then He will raise him up when He wills.
Well, no! [Man] does not do what He commands him.
Let man, therefore, consider his food:
It is We who pour out abundant water,
then We split the earth by cracks
and let grain grow there,
vineyards and vegetables,
olive and palm trees,
lush gardens,
fruits and grasslands,
for your enjoyment you and your cattle.
Then when the crash comes,
on the day when a man flees from his brother,
of his mother, of his father,
his partner and children,
for each of them, on that day, will have his own case to occupy it.
On that day, there will be radiant faces,
smiling and joyful.
Just as there will be faces covered with dust on that day,
covered in darkness.
These are the infidels, the libertines.
When the sun is darkened,
and the stars will become dull,
and the mountains set in motion,
and the camels at term, neglected,
and the wild beasts, gathered,
and the seas alight,
and the mated souls
and that the little girl buried alive will be asked
for what sin she was killed.
And when the leaves are spread,
and the flayed sky
and the furnace fanned,
and Paradise at hand,
every soul will know what he has presented.
No!... I swear by planets that orbit
that run and disappear
by night when it comes!
and by the dawn when it exhales its breath!
This [the Qur'an] is the word of a noble Messenger,
endowed with great strength, and having a high rank with the Master of the Throne,
obeyed, up there, and trustworthy.
Your companion (Muhammad) is by no means mad;
he did see him (Gabriel), on the clear horizon
and he does not keep to himself what has been revealed to him.
And this [the Qur'an] is not the word of a banished devil.
Where are you going?
This is just a reminder to the universe,
for those of you who want to follow the straight path.
But you can only will, if Allah wills, [He], the Lord of the Universe;
When the sky breaks,
and the stars will scatter,
and the seas will confuse their waters,
and that the tombs will be overturned,
every soul will then know what it has accomplished and what it has put off doing.
O man! What has deceived you about your Lord, the Noble,
Who created you, then molded and constituted you harmoniously?
He has fashioned you into the form He wanted.
No...! [in spite of everything] you call the Retribution a lie;
while guards watch over you,
noble scribes,
who know what you're doing.
The good will certainly be in a [garden] of delight,
And the libertines will, of course, be in a furnace
where they will burn, on the day of Retribution
unable to escape.
And who will tell you what the Day of Retribution is?
Again, who will tell you what the Day of Retribution is?
The day when no soul can do anything for the benefit of another soul. And on that day, the commandment will be to Allah.
Woe to fraudsters
who, when they have measured for themselves, require full measure,
and who, when they themselves measure or weigh for others, cause [them] loss.
Do they not think that they will be resurrected?
on a terrible day,
the day when people will stand before the Lord of the Universe?
No...! But in truth the book of the libertines will be in the Sijjîn -
and who will tell you what the Sijjin is? -
A book already sealed (finished).
Woe, on that day, to the deniers,
which belie the Day of Retribution.
Now only every transgressor, sinner, denies it:
who, when Our verses are recited to him, says, "[These are] the tales of the ancients!"
Not at all, but what they have accomplished covers their hearts.
Let them beware! Verily on that day a veil will prevent them from seeing their Lord,
then they will certainly burn in the Furnace;
Then they will say, 'This is what you called a lie!'
Let them beware! The Book of Good Will Be in the Illiyûn.
and who will tell you what the Illiyûn is? -
a sealed book!
Those who are close to [Allah: the angels] testify to this.
The good will be in [a Garden] of delight,
on the sofas, they look.
You will recognize in their faces the radiance of bliss.
They are served to drink a pure, sealed nectar,
leaving an aftertaste of musk. Let those who covet it compete [to acquire it]
It is mixed with the drink of Tasnîm,
spring from which those close drink.
The criminals laughed at those who believed,
and, passing by them, they glanced at each other,
and, returning to their families, they returned jokingly,
and when they saw them, they said, "These are really the ones who have gone astray."
However, they were not sent to be their guardians.
Today, therefore, it is those who believed who laugh at the infidels
on the sofas, they look.
Did the infidels get the reward for what they did?
When the sky will be torn apart
and will obey his Lord - and do what he must do -
and the earth shall be levelled,
and that it will cast off what is in its bosom (the dead) and empty itself,
and that she will obey her Lord - and do what she must do -
O man! You who strive for your Lord unceasingly, you will then meet Him.
Whoever receives his book in his right hand,
will be subject to easy judgment,
and will return rejoicingly to his family
As for the one who receives his book behind his back,
he will invoke destruction upon himself,
and it will burn in a blazing fire.
For he was all joyful among his own people,
and he thought that he would never rise again
Yes, you are! Certainly, his Lord was watching him perfectly.
No!... I swear by the twilight,
and by the night and what it envelops,
and by the moon when it becomes full moon!
You will, of course, go through successive states!
What do they have not to believe?
and not to prostrate themselves when the Qur'an is read to them?
But those who do not believe, call him a lie.
Allah knows what they are hiding.
Tell them, therefore, a painful punishment.
Except those who believe and do good deeds: to them an uninterrupted reward.
By the sky with the constellations!
and on the promised day!
and by the witness and what we testify to!
Perish the people of the Uhdûd,
by the fire full of fuel,
while they were sitting all around,
they were thus witnesses of what they did to the believers,
whom they reproached them only for believing in Allah, the Mighty, the Worthy of praise,
To whom belongs the kingdom of heaven and earth. Allah is witness to all things.
Those who put believers to trial and then do not repent will have the punishment of Hell and the torment of fire.
Those who believe and do good deeds will have Gardens under which streams flow. This is the great success.
The response of your Lord is dreadful.
It is He, indeed, who begins (creation) and remakes it.
And He is the Forgiving, the All-Loving,
The Master of the Throne, the All-Glorious,
He does everything He wants perfectly.
Has the story of the armies come to you,
of Pharaoh, and of Thamûd?
But those who do not believe persist in denying,
while Allah, behind them, surrounds them on all sides.
But it is rather a glorified Qur'an
preserved on a Tablet (with Allah).
By the sky and by the nocturnal star
And who will tell you what the nocturnal star is?
It is the brightly bright star.
There is no soul that does not have a guardian over it.
Let man, then, consider what he was created of.
It was created from a squirt of water
Exit from between the lumbar and ribs.
Allah is indeed able to resurrect him.
The day when hearts will reveal their secrets,
He will then have neither strength nor helper.
By the sky that brings back the rain!
and by the earth that splits!
This [the Qur'an] is indeed a decisive word [which decides between true and false].
and not a frivolous joke!
They use a ruse,
and I also use My plan.
Therefore grant (O Prophet) a delay to the infidels: grant them a short delay.
Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High,
He Who has created and arranged harmoniously,
who decreed and guided,
and who has grown pasture,
and then made dark hay out of it.
We will make you recite (the Qur'an), so that you will not forget
than what Allah wants. For He knows what appears in broad daylight as well as what is hidden.
We'll put you on the easiest path.
Remember, therefore, where the Reminder should be useful.
Whoever fears (Allah) will remember,
and the great unfortunate will depart from it,
who will burn in the greatest Fire,
where he will neither die nor live.
Verily, he who purifies himself succeeds,
and remembers the name of his Lord, and then celebrates Salah.
But you prefer the present life,
while the hereafter is better and more lasting.
This is certainly to be found in the ancient Leaves,
the Leaves of Abraham and Moses.
Has the story of the envelope come down to you?
On that day, there will be humiliated faces,
preoccupied, harassed.
They will burn in a blazing fire,
and will be watered by a boiling spring.
There will be no other food for them than thorny plants [darî'],
which neither fattens nor appeases hunger.
On that day, there will be happy faces,
satisfied with their efforts,
in a high garden,
where they hear no trivialities.
There, there will be a flowing spring.
There, high couches
and cuts made
and stored cushions
and carpets spread.
Do they not then consider camels, how they were created,
and the heavens how it is exalted,
and the mountains how they are erected
And how is the earth levelled?
Well, call back! You're just a reminder,
and you are not a ruler over them.
Except the one who turns his back and does not believe,
then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment.
To Us is their return.
Then it is up to us to hold them accountable.
By the Dawn!
And by the ten nights!
By the odd and even!
And by the night when it passes!
Is not this an oath for one endowed with intelligence?
Have you not seen how your Lord has dealt with the 'Aad
[with] Iram, [the city] of the remarkable column,
of which the like was never built among the cities?
and with the Thamûd who carved the rock in the valley?
and with Pharaoh, the man with the spikes?
All of them were transgressors in [their] countries,
and had committed a great deal of disorder there.
So your Lord poured out a scourge of punishment on them.
For your Lord is on the lookout.
As for man, when his Lord tests him by honoring him and showering him with blessings, he says, "My Lord has honored me."
But on the other hand, when He tests him by restricting his sustenance, he says, "My Lord has degraded me."
Of course not! It is rather you who are not generous to the orphans;
who do not encourage one another to feed the poor,
who devour the inheritance with voracious greed,
and love the riches of boundless love.
Beware! When the earth is completely pulverized,
and that your Lord will come and the angels, rank by rank,
and that on that day Hell will be brought; On that day, man will remember. But what good will it do him to remember?
He will say: "Alas! Would that I had done good for my future life!
On that day, therefore, no one will know how to chastise as He chastises,
and no one will know how to garrotte like Him garrotting.
"O thou soul at peace,
return to your Lord, satisfied and accepted;
enter therefore among My servants,
and enter My Paradise."
No!... I swear by this City!
and you are a resident in this city.
And by the Father and what he generates!
We have, of course, created man for a life of struggle.
Does he think that no one will be able to do anything against him?
He says, "I have wasted a lot of goods."
Does he think that no one has seen him?
Have We not assigned him two eyes,
And a tongue and two lips?
Have We not guided him to both ways?
However, he is not going down the difficult path!
And who will tell you what the hard way is?
It is to loosen a yoke [to free a slave],
or feeding, in a day of famine,
a close orphan
or a poor man in destitution.
And it is also to be one of those who believe and enjoin one another endurance, and enjoin mercy to one another.
These are the people of the right;
while those who do not believe in Our verses are the people of the left.
The Fire will close in on them.
By the sun and by its brightness!
And by the moon when it follows him!
And by the day when he lights it up!
And by the night when it envelops him!
And by heaven and Him who built it!
And by the earth and Him who spread it!
And by the soul and Him who has harmoniously fashioned it;
and then inspired him with his immorality, as well as his piety!
Surely he who purifies it has succeeded.
And the one who corrupts it is lost, of course.
The Thamûd, by their transgression, have cried false,
when the most wretched of them arose (to kill the she-camel)
The Messenger of Allah said to them: "The she-camel of Allah! Let her drink.
But they called him a liar and killed her. So their Lord destroyed them for their sin and extended His chastisement to all.
And Allah has no fear of consequences.
By the night when it envelops everything!
By the day when it lights up!
And by what He created, male and female!
Your efforts are divergent.
The One Who Gives and Fears (Allah)
and declares the greatest reward to be true
We will make it easier for him to make him happy.
And as for the one who is miserly, he dispenses (from the worship of Allah),
and treats the greatest reward as a lie,
We will facilitate the way for him in the greatest difficulty,
and his riches will be of no use to him when he is thrown (into the Fire).
It is for Us, indeed, to guide;
To Us, indeed, belongs the last life and the present life.
So I warned you of a blazing Fire
where only the damned will burn,
who denies and turns his back;
when the pious will be removed from it,
who gives his goods to purify himself
and from whom no one enjoys a selfish benefit,
but only for the search for the Face of his Lord the Most High.
And certainly, he will soon be satisfied!
By the Rising Day!
And by night when it covers everything!
Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you.
The last life is certainly better for you than the present life.
Your Lord will certainly grant you [His favors], and then you will be satisfied.
Didn't He find you an orphan? So He welcomed you!
Didn't He find you lost? So He guided you.
Didn't He find you poor? So He enriched you.
As for the orphan, therefore, do not mistreat him.
As for the applicant, do not reject it.
And as for the benefit of your Lord, proclaim it.
Have We not opened your breast for you?
And have We not unburdened you with the burden
that burdened your back?
And exalted your fame for you?
Beside the difficulty is, of course, an ease!
Beside the difficulty is, of course, an ease!
When you set yourself free, therefore, arise,
and to your Lord yearns.
By the fig tree and the olive tree!
And by Mount Sinin!
And by this Safe City!
We have certainly created man in the most perfect form.
Then we brought it down to the lowest level,
except those who believe and do good deeds: these will have an uninterrupted reward.
After that, what makes you call retribution a lie?
Is not Allah the wisest of Judges?
Read, in the name of your Lord who created,
who created man of an adhesion.
Lily! Your Lord is the Most Noble,
who taught with the pen [the calam],
taught man what he did not know.
Beware! Truly man becomes rebellious,
as soon as he thinks that he can be self-sufficient (because of his wealth).
But it is to your Lord that the return is.
Have you seen the one who forbids
Is it up to a servant of Allah [Muhammad] to celebrate Salah?
Do you see if he is on the right track,
or if he commands piety?
Do you see if he denies it and turns his back?
Does he not know that Allah truly sees?
Of course not! If it does not cease, We will certainly seize it by the toupee,
the toupee of a liar, of a sinner.
Let him, therefore, call his assembly.
We will call the guardians [of Hell].
No! Do not obey him; but prostrate yourself and draw nearer.
We sent it down (the Qur'an) in the night of Al-Qadr.
And who will tell you what the night of Al-Qadr is?
The night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.
During this time the Angels and the Spirit descend, by permission of their Lord for all orders.
It is peace and salvation until the dawn appears.
The infidels among the People of the Book, as well as the Associates, will not cease to disbelieve until the clear Proof comes to them:
a Messenger from Allah, who recites purified leaves to them,
in which are found prescriptions of perfect rectitude.
And those to whom the Book was given did not divide until after the proof had come to them.
However, they were commanded only to worship Allah, worshipping Him exclusively, performing Salah and paying Zakat. And this is the religion of righteousness.
The infidels among the People of the Book, as well as the Associates, will go to the fire of Hell, to dwell there forever. Of all creation, they are the worst.
As for those who believe and do good deeds, they are the best in all creation.
Their reward with Allah will be the Gardens of Abode, under which the streams flow, to dwell there forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This will be the reward of him who fears his Lord.
When the earth trembles with a violent earthquake,
and that the earth will bring out its burdens,
and the man will say, "What is the matter with her?"
on that day, she will tell her story,
according to what your Lord has revealed to him.
On that day, people will go out separately to be shown their works.
Whoever does good, even if it is the weight of an atom, will see it,
and whoever does harm, even if it is the weight of an atom, will see it.
By the steeds that pant,
that cause sparks to fly,
who attack in the morning,
and thus make the dust fly,
and penetrate into the centre of the enemy's troops.
Man is, indeed, ungrateful to his Lord;
and yet he is certainly a witness of this;
and for the love of riches he is certainly ardent.
Does he not know, then, that when what is in the tombs is overturned,
and that what is in the breasts will be revealed,
on that day, indeed, their Lord will be Perfectly Knower of them?
The crash!
What is crash?
And who will tell you what the crash is?
This is the day when people will be like scattered butterflies,
and the mountains like carded wool;
as for the one whose scales will be heavy
he will live a pleasant life;
and as for the one whose scales will be light,
his mother [destination] is a very deep abyss.
And who will tell you what it is?
It is a blazing Fire.
The race for riches distracts you,
until you visit the tombs.
Of course not! You'll find out soon!
(Again)! You'll find out soon!
Certainly! If you only knew of certain science.
You will certainly see the Furnace.
Then, you will certainly see it, with the eye of certainty.
Then, certainly, you will be questioned, on that day, about delicacies.
By Time!
Man is certainly in perdition,
except those who believe and do good works, enjoin one another the truth and enjoin one another with endurance.
Woe to every slanderer slanderer,
who amasses a fortune and counts it,
thinking that his fortune would immortalize him.
Of course not! He will certainly be thrown into the Hutamah.
And who will tell you what Hutamah is?
Allah's Fanned Fire
which rises to the hearts.
He will close in on them,
in extended columns (of flames).
Have you not seen how your Lord has dealt with the people of the Elephant?
Has He not made their cunning completely vain?
and sent birds upon them in flocks
who threw stones of clay at them?
And He made them like a chewed straw.
Because of the pact of the Coraïch,
Of their pact [concerning] winter and summer travel.
Let them therefore worship the Lord of this House [the Ka'ba],
who fed them against hunger and reassured them from fear!
Do you see the one who calls the Retribution a lie?
It is he who rejects the orphan,
and which does not encourage the feeding of the poor.
Woe, then, to those who pray
while neglecting (and delaying) their Salat,
which are full of ostentation,
and refuse the utensil (to the one who needs it).
Verily We have granted you Abundance.
Perform Salat for your Lord and sacrifice.
Whoever hates you will certainly be without posterity.
Say: "O you infidels!
I don't worship what you adore.
And you are not worshippers of what I worship.
I am not a worshipper of what you worship.
And you are not worshippers of what I worship.
Yours is your religion, and I am my religion."
When Allah's help comes and victory,
and you see people entering the religion of Allah in crowds,
then, with praise, praise the glory of your Lord and implore His forgiveness. For He is the great One who welcomes repentance.
Let the two hands of Abu Lahab perish and let him perish.
His fortune is of no use to him, nor is what he has acquired.
He will be burned in a fire full of flames,
so his wife, the wood-bearer,
around his neck, a rope of fibres.
Say: "He is Allah, the One.
Allah, the only One who is implored for what we desire.
He never begotten, nor was he begotten.
And no one is equal to Him."
Say: "I seek protection from the Lord of the dawning dawn,
against the evil of beings whom He created,
against the evil of darkness when it deepens,
against the evil of those who blow [witches] on the knots,
and against the evil of the envious when he envies."
Say: "I seek protection from the Lord of men.
The Sovereign of men,
God of men,
against the evil of the evil counselor, stealthy,
who breathes evil into the breasts of men,
whether he (the advisor) is a jinn, or a human being."
Book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
Abraham became Isaac's father. Isaac became Jacob's father. Jacob is the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah begat Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Pérez is Hezron's father. Hezron fathered Ram.
Ram fathered Amminadab. Amminadab begat Nahshon. Nachschon begets Salmon.
Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab. Boaz begat Obed of Ruth. Obed is the father of Jesse.
Jesse begat King David. King David begat Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
Solomon begat Rehoboam. Rehoboam begat Abijah. Abija begat Asa .
Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat is the father of Jehoram. Joram begat Uzziah.
Uzziah is the father of Jotham. Jotham is the father of Ahaz. Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
Hezekiah is the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amun. Amun begat Josiah.
Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile in Babylon.
After the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah became Shealtiel's father. Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud. Abiud is Eliakim's father. Eliakim is the father of Azor.
Azor fathered Zadok. Zadok begat Achim. Achim begat Eliud.
Eliud is the father of Eleazar. Eleazar begat Matthan. Matthan begat Jacob.
Jacob begat Joseph, husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, called Christ.
Thus, all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile in Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon until Christ, fourteen generations.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place: After the betrothal of Mary, his mother, to Joseph, before they met, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, being a just man, and not wishing to make her a public example, intended to repudiate her secretly.
But while he was thinking of these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which was conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
She gave birth to a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who will save his people from their sins. »
Now all this happened in order that what was spoken by the Lord by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and give birth to a son. He will be called Immanuel," which is, according to the interpretation, "God with us."
Joseph rose from his sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took his wife for himself;
and he did not know her sexually until she had given birth to his firstborn son. He gave him the name of Jesus.
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the time of King Herod, behold, the wise men from the east went to Jerusalem, saying:
"Where is he who was born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and we have come to bow down to him. »
When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Gathering together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he asked them where Christ was to be born.
They answered him, "To Bethlehem of Judea," for this is written by the prophet,
"You, Bethlehem, land of Judea. are by no means the least among the princes of Judah; for out of you will come a governor who will be the shepherd of my people, Israel. »
Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and he learned from them at what exact hour the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem and said to them, "Go and fetch the little child. When you have found it, let me know, so that I too may come and worship it. »
When they had heard the king, they went away. And behold, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, until it came to place itself above the place where the little child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy.
They went into the house and saw the little child with Mary, his mother; they prostrated themselves and adored him. Opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh.
Having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they returned to their country by another way.
Now when they were gone, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the little child and his mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the little child to destroy him."
He got up, took the little child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt,
where he remained until the death of Herod, that what the Lord had foretold through the prophet might be fulfilled, "I have called my son out of Egypt."
Then Herod, seeing that he was being mocked by the wise, was exceedingly angry, and he sent to kill all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding country, from the age of two years and under, according to the exact time he had learned from the wise.
Then was fulfilled what had been foretold by Jeremiah the prophet, in these words:
"A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentations, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children; she would not be comforted, for they are no more. »
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in Egypt in a dream, and said,
"Arise, take the little child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the life of the little child are dead."
He arose, took the little child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,
and came to settle in a city called Nazareth, that what had been spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: he shall be called a Nazarene.
At that time John the Baptist came to preach in the wilderness of Judea, saying:
"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
For it was he who was foretold by the prophet Isaiah, saying, "The voice of him crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight! »
John himself wore camel hair clothes and a leather belt around his waist. It fed on locusts and wild honey.
Then the people of Jerusalem, and of all Judea, and of the whole region of the Jordan, came to him.
They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
But when he saw a great number of Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, "O races of vipers, who taught you to flee from the wrath to come?
Produce fruits worthy of repentance!
Do not say to yourself, "We have Abraham for our father," for I tell you that God can raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
Even now, the axe is at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to wear his sandals. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
He has the van in his hand, and he will clean its area thoroughly. He will gather his wheat in the barn, but he will burn the tares in an unquenchable fire. »
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John prevented him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"
But Jesus answered and said to him, "Let it be done now, for it is the proper way for us to fulfill all righteousness." So he allowed it.
Jesus, after being baptized, came directly out of the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descend like a dove and come upon him.
And behold, a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
As he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was then hungry.
The tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"
Then the devil led him into the holy city. He placed it on the pinnacle of the temple,
and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'They will carry you on their hands, so that your foot does not strike against a stone.'"
Jesus said to him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
The devil took him again to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to him, "I will give you all these things, if you will bow down and worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Go behind me, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve no one but him."
Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.
Now, when Jesus heard that John had been betrayed, he withdrew to Galilee.
Leaving Nazareth, he came to settle at Capernaum, which is near the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
that what was foretold by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, in these words:
"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, towards the sea, beyond the Jordan, the Galilee of the Gentiles,
the people who sat in darkness saw a great light; To those who sat in the region and the shadow of death, for them the light has risen. »
From then on, Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. »
As he walked along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, who were casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
He said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
When he left there, he saw two other brothers, James, son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in the boat with Zebedee, their father, who were mending their nets. He called them .
Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.
Jesus went through all Galilee, teaching in the synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every sickness and infirmity among the people.
The news of his coming spread throughout Syria. All the sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed by demons, epileptics and paralytics, were brought to him; and he healed them.
Numerous crowds, from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan, followed him.
Seeing the crowd, he went up to the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
He opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who weep, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
Happy are the peacemakers! for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Happy will you be when, for my sake, you are insulted, persecuted, and all kinds of evil are falsely spoken against you.
Rejoice, and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. For thus the prophets who were before you were persecuted.
"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? He is then good for nothing, except to be thrown out and trampled under the feet of men.
You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill cannot be hidden.
Nor do you light a lamp to put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand, and it shines for all who are in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
"Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
For, verily, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one little letter or one little stroke of the pen will disappear from the law until all is accomplished.
Therefore, whoever transgresses one of these lesser commandments and teaches others to do so, will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
For I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "Thou shalt not commit murder, and "He that commits murder shall be exposed to judgment."
But I tell you that anyone who gets angry with his brother for no reason will be in danger of judgment. The one who says to his brother: "Raca! risks the council. Whoever says, "You are mad," will risk the fire of hell.
"If, therefore, thou shalt present thy offering at the altar, and there thou remembers that thy brother has something against thee,
leave your offering there before the altar, and go away. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your offering.
Quickly come to an agreement with your adversary while you are with him on the way, lest the procurator deliver you up to the judge, the judge deliver you up to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
In any case, I tell you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the last penny.
You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery';
but I tell you that whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more advantageous for you that one of your members should perish than your whole body should be cast into hell.
If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is more advantageous for you that one of your members should perish, that your whole body should be cast into hell.
It was also said: "If anyone divorces his wife, let him give her a letter of divorce."
But I tell you that if anyone divorces his wife, except on account of sexual immorality, he makes her an adulteress, and if anyone marries her while she is divorced, he commits adultery.
"You have also heard that it was said to the elders, 'You shall not swear falsely, but you shall fulfill your oaths to the Lord.'
But I say to you do not swear at all, nor by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Neither shall you swear by your head, for one cannot make a hair white or black.
But let your "yes" be "yes" and your "no" be "no". Everything that is more than that belongs to the evil one.
You have heard that it was said: 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth'.
But I say to you, do not resist him who does evil; but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, hold out the other to him also.
If someone chases you to take your cloak, leave your cloak for him too.
If someone forces you to walk a kilometer, do two with him.
Give to him who asks you, and do not reject him who wants to borrow you.
You have learned that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat and persecute you,
that ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise on the wicked and on the good, and he causes rain to fall on the just and on the unjust.
For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Don't the tax collectors themselves do the same?
If you just greet your friends, what do you do more than others? Don't tax collectors do the same?
Therefore you must be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect.
"Take heed that you do not do your charity before men, that you may be seen by them, or you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
Thus, when you do acts of mercy, do not blow the trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order to bring glory to men. I tell you for sure, they have received their reward.
But when you do works of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
that your works of mercy may be in secret; then your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly.
"When you pray, you will not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in synagogues and on street corners, that they may be seen by men. Verily, I say to you, they have received their reward.
But you, when you pray, go into your inner chamber, and, having closed your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly.
In praying, do not use vain repetitions, as the pagans do; for they imagine that they will be heard because they have spoken much.
So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
Pray thus: 'Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
Do not subject us to temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thee is thee the kingdom, the power, and the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses.
"Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with their sad faces. For they disfigure their faces so that men may see them fasting. I tell you for sure, they have received their reward.
But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
so that men may not see that you are fasting, but your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.
"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal;
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break through and steal;
for where your treasure is, there will your heart also be.
"The lamp of the body is the eye. So if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be filled with light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be in darkness. If, then, the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and mammon.
Therefore I say to you not to worry about your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor for your body: what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, they do not reap, they do not gather in barns. Your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Which of you, by worrying, can add a moment to its lifespan?
Why are you worried about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don't work, they don't spin,
and I tell you that Solomon himself, in all his glory, was not clothed like them.
But if God thus dresses the grass of the field, which exists today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, who are of little faith?
So don't worry, saying, "What shall we eat?", "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we be clothed in?"
For the heathen seek all these things; your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
But first seek the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you also.
So don't worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. The misfortune of each day is enough.
"Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.
For by whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged, and by whatever measure you measure, you will be measured.
Why do you see the spot in your brother's eye, and do you not consider the beam in your own eye?
Or how will you say to your brother, "Let me remove the speck from your eye," and behold, the beam is in your own eye?
Hypocrite! First remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
"Do not give to dogs what is sacred, nor throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot, turn around, and tear you to pieces.
"Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek , and you will find . Knock, and it will be opened to you.
For whoever asks receives . He who seeks finds . To the one who knocks, we will open .
Or who among you is who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
Or, if he asks for a fish, who will give him a snake?
If, then, wicked as you are, you know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him.
Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, you will do to them also; for this is the law and the prophets.
"Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way is wide, which leads to perdition, and there are many who enter by it.
How narrow is the gate and how narrow is the path that leads to life! There are few who find it.
"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but who are in reality ravaging wolves.
It is by their fruits that you will recognize them. Do you pick grapes from thorns or figs from thistles?
In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.
Any tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
It is therefore by their fruits that you will recognize them.
"Not all those who say to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
In that day, many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, cast out demons in your name, and done many miracles in your name?
Then I will say to them: "I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity."
"Whoever hears these words which I speak, and does them, I will compare him to a wise man who built his house on a rock.
The rain fell, the floods came, the winds blew and beat this house, but it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.
Whoever hears these words that I say and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
The rain fell, the floods came, the winds blew and hit that house, and it fell, and its fall was great. »
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowd was struck by his teaching,
for he taught them with authority, and not like the scribes.
When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
Behold, a leper came to him and adored him, saying, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will. Be purified. Immediately, his leprosy was cleansed.
Jesus said to him, "Take care not to tell anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, as a witness for them. »
When he arrived at Capernaum, a centurion came to him for help.
saying, "Lord, my servant is lying in the house, paralyzed and severely tormented."
Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
The centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. Just say one word, and my servant will be healed.
For I too am a man of authority, having soldiers under my command. I said to this one, "Go," and he goes; I said to him, "Come," and he comes; I said to my servant, "Do this," and he does it. »
When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I say to you, I have not found so great a faith, not even in Israel.
I say to you, many will come from the east and the west and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
but the children of the kingdom will be cast into outer darkness. There will be crying and gnashing of teeth. »
Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, let it happen. Let it be done for you what you have believed. His servant was healed that very hour.
When Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying down and suffering from a fever.
He touched her hand, and the fever left her. So she got up and served him.
When evening came, several demon-possessed persons were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick,
that what had been foretold by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: "He has taken our infirmities and borne our sicknesses."
Now, seeing a great crowd around him, Jesus gave the order to cross over to the other bank.
A scribe came up to him and said, "Master, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, let me go and bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
He got into a boat, and his disciples followed him.
Behold, a violent storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves; but he was asleep.
The disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, "Save us, Lord! We are dying! »
He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O people of little faith?" Then he arose, threatened the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
Men were astonished and said, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
When he arrived on the other side, in the land of the Gergesenians, two demon-possessed persons met him there, coming out of the tombs, extremely ferocious, so that no one could pass through it.
And behold, they cried out, "What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before time? »
Now far from them there was a herd of numerous pigs grazing.
The demons begged him, saying, "If you drive us out, let us go to the herd of pigs."
He said to them, "Go!" They went out and entered the herd of pigs; and behold, the whole herd of pigs threw themselves from the top of the cliff into the sea and died in the water.
Those who had fed them fled and went into the city, telling everything, including what had happened to those who were possessed by demons.
And behold, the whole city went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to move away from their borders.
He got into a boat, crossed the boat, and arrived in his city.
And behold, a paralyzed man was brought to him, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "My son, rejoice! Your sins are forgiven you. »
Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
For which is easier, to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Arise and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
He got up and went to his house.
But the crowd, seeing this, marveled and glorified God, who had given such power to men.
As Jesus passed by, he saw a man named Matthew, sitting at the tax collection desk. He said to him, "Follow me." He got up and followed him.
As he was sitting in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees, seeing this, said to his disciples, "Why does your master eat with publicans and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do.
But you will learn what it means: "I want mercy and not sacrifices, for I have come not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Then John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom lament while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the piece would detach from the garment, and a more serious hole would be made.
Nor is new wine put into old wineskins, otherwise the wineskins would burst, the wine would spill out, and the wineskins would be ruined. No, the new wine is put in fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. »
While he was telling them these things, behold, a chief came and prostrated himself before him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus arose and followed him, as well as his disciples.
Behold, a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years came behind him and touched the fringe of his garment;
for she said to herself, "If I only touch her garment, I will be healed."
But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said to her, "My daughter, rejoice! Your faith has healed you. And the woman was healed from that hour.
When Jesus entered the chief's house and saw the flute-players and the crowd in great disorder,
he said to them, "Make way, for the maiden is not dead, but she is asleep." They laughed at him.
But as the crowd had withdrawn, he entered, took her by the hand, and the young girl stood up.
The report of this spread throughout the country.
As Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying, "Have mercy on us, son of David!"
When he had entered the house, the blind approached him. Jesus said to them, "Do you think I can do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes, saying, "Let it be done to you according to your faith."
Then their eyes were opened. Jesus gave them a strict command, saying, "See that no one knows anything of this."
But they went out and spread his fame throughout the country.
As they were going out, behold, a dumb man possessed by a demon was brought to him.
The demon having been cast out, the dumb one spoke. The crowd was in awe and said, "We have never seen anything like it in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "By the prince of demons, he casts out demons."
Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in the synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every sickness and ailment among the people.
But when he saw the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them, for they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
He then said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest. »
He called his twelve disciples to himself, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every sickness and infirmity.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first, Simon, called Peter; André, his brother; James, son of Zebedee; Jean, his brother;
Philippe; Barthélemy; Thomas; Matthew, publican; James, son of Alphaeus; Lebbeus, also called Thaddeus;
Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
Jesus sent these twelve people and gave them this order: "Do not go among the Gentiles, nor enter into any city of the Samaritans.
Go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
On the way, preach saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
Heal the sick, purify the lepers, cast out demons. You have received freely, give freely.
Do not take gold, silver, or brass in your belts.
Do not take a bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff; for the worker deserves his food.
In whatever town or village you enter, seek who is worthy of it, and remain there until you go.
When you enter a house, greet it.
If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
If anyone does not receive you or listen to your words, when you leave this house or this city, shake the dust from your feet.
Verily, I say to you, on the day of judgment, the land of Sodom and Gomorrah will be more tolerable than this city.
"Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be wise therefore as serpents and harmless as doves.
But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a witness for them and for the nations.
But when you are betrayed, do not be anxious about what you say or how you will do it, for what you say will be given to you at that very hour.
For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
"The brother shall deliver his brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against the parents and put them to death.
You will be hated by all because of my name, but he who endures to the end will be saved.
But if you are persecuted in this city, flee to the next; for I tell you with all certainty, you will not have passed through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man has come.
"The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.
It is enough that the disciple be like his master, and the servant like his lord. If they called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more so those of his house!
Therefore do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing hidden that is not revealed, nor concealed that is not known.
What I say to you in darkness, speak in full light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who is able to destroy the soul and body in hell.
"Aren't two sparrows sold for a piece of assarion? None of them falls to the ground without the will of your Father.
But the hairs on your head are all numbered.
So don't be afraid. You are more valuable than many sparrows.
And so, whoever confesses me before men, I will confess him also before my Father who is in heaven.
But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to send peace, but a sword.
For I have come to set man against her father, daughter against her mother, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
Man will have the people of his own house as enemies.
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who seeks his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
"He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of the prophet. Whoever receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of a righteous person.
Whoever gives one of these little ones a simple glass of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly, I tell you, he will not lose his reward in any way. »
When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities.
Now when John heard the works of Christ in the prison, he sent two of his disciples
and said to him, "Are you the one who is coming, or must we look for another?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things that you hear and see:
the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
Happy is he who finds in me no occasion to fall! »
As they were leaving, Jesus began to say to the crowd about John, "What did you go to see in the wilderness? A reed shaken by the wind?
And you, what did you go to see? A man dressed in soft clothes? Behold, those who wear soft garments are in the houses of kings.
But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
For it is he of whom it is written: "Behold, I send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way before you."
I tell you with all certainty, among those who were born of women, there was no one greater than John the Baptizer; but the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
From the time of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven has been subjected to violence, and the violent take possession of it by force.
For all the prophets and the law prophesied unto John.
If you are willing to receive him, this is Elijah, who is to come.
Let him who has ears to hear, hear.
"But what shall I compare this generation to? She looks like children sitting in the public squares, calling out to their companions
and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance. We wept for you, and you did not lament."
For John came without eating or drinking, and they say, "He has a devil."
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and it is said, "Behold a glutton and a drunkard, the friend of publicans and sinners." But wisdom is justified by its children. »
Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his exploits had been accomplished, because they did not repent.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done among you had been done at Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, with sackcloth and ashes.
But I say to you, on the Day of Judgment, Tyre and Sidon will be more tolerable than you.
You, Capernaum, who have ascended to heaven, will descend to hell. For if the miracles that were done in Sodom had been done in your house, it would have remained until today.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for you. »
At that time, Jesus answered, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to children.
Yes, Father, for it has been pleasing in your sight.
All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; and no one knows the Father, except the Son and the one to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.
"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. »
At that time, Jesus was walking through the wheat fields on the Sabbath. His disciples, who were hungry, began to pluck ears of corn and to eat.
But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to him, "Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
But he said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?
how he entered the house of God and ate the shewbread, which he was not lawful to eat, nor to those who were with him, but only to the priests?
Have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests of the temple profane the Sabbath and are not guilty?
But I tell you that someone greater than the temple is here.
But if you had known what it means, "I want mercy and not sacrifices," you would not have condemned the innocent.
For the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath. »
He left there and entered their synagogue.
And behold, there was a man there with a withered hand. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" in order to accuse him.
He said to them, "Who among you is the man who has a sheep and who, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, does not take it up and pull it out?
How much more valuable is man than a sheep! It is therefore permissible to do good on the Sabbath. »
Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out; and it was made whole, like the other.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, in order to destroy him.
Jesus, perceiving this, withdrew from thence. A great crowd followed him; he heals them all,
and commanded them not to make it known,
that what was foretold by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, in these words:
"This is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him. He will proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not fight, he will not shout, no one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bruised reed. He will not extinguish a flax that smokes, until he leads righteousness to victory.
In his name, the nations will hope. »
Then a demoniac was brought to him, blind and dumb, and he healed him, so that the blind and the dumb spoke and saw.
The whole crowd was amazed, and said, "Is this the son of David?"
But the Pharisees, when they heard this, said, "This man casts out demons only through Beelzebub, the prince of demons."
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is devastated, and every city or house divided against itself cannot stand.
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How, then, will his kingdom stand?
If it is by Beelzebub that I cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? That is why they will be your judges.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or how can one enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods, if one does not first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.
"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me is scattered.
Therefore I say to you, all sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven to men.
Whoever speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost will not be forgiven him either in this world or in the one to come.
"Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.
Races of vipers, how can you, being wicked, say good things? For it is of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.
The good man, from his good treasure, draws good things, and the evil man, from his bad treasure, draws bad things.
I say to you, whatever idle words men speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment.
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned. »
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees spoke up and said, "Master, we want to see a sign from you."
But he answered them, "A wicked and adulterous generation is looking for a sign; but he will be given no other sign than that of the prophet Jonah.
For just as Jonah spent three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at Jonah's preaching; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is there.
The queen of the south will rise at the time of the judgment of this generation and condemn it, for she has come from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, there is one here greater than Solomon.
"When an unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through places without water, seeking rest, and he finds it not.
Then he said, "I will return to my house from which I came"; and when he returned, he found it empty, swept and put away.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there. This man's last state becomes worse than the first. The same will be true for this evil generation. »
While he was still talking to the crowd, behold, his mother and brothers were standing outside, trying to speak to him.
Someone said to him, "Here are your mother and your brothers who are outside and trying to talk to you."
But he answered the one who spoke to him, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers? »
He stretched out his hand to his disciples, and said, "Behold my mother and my brothers!
For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and my sister, and my mother. »
On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat down by the sea.
Great crowds gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat down; and the whole crowd was standing on the beach.
He spoke to them of many things in parables, and said, "Behold, a peasant has gone out to sow."
As he sowed seeds fell by the side of the road, and the birds came to devour them.
Others fell on rocky ground, where there was not much earth, and immediately they grew, because they had no depth of earth.
When the sun rose, they were burned. As they had no root, they dried up.
Others fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and suffocated them.
Others have fallen into the good soil and have borne fruit: some a hundred times more, others sixty, others thirty.
Let him who has ears to hear hear. »
The disciples came to him and said, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
He answered them, "It is given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.
For to him who has, he will be given, and he will have abundance; but to him who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.
Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear and do not understand.
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, who says, "By hearing you shall hear, and in no way will understand; By seeing, you will see, and will in no way be perceived;
for the hearts of this people have become insensible, their ears are deaf, and they have closed their eyes; or else they might be able to perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn again, and I would heal them.
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
For verily, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them; and hear the things which you hear, and have not heard them.
"Listen therefore to the parable of the farmer.
When someone hears the word of the Kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and plucks up what has been sown in his heart. Here is what has been sown by the wayside.
That which has been sown on the rocks is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;
but it has no root in itself, it only endures for a time. When oppression or persecution arises because of speech, he immediately totters.
That which has been sown among thorns is he who hears the word; but the cares of the present age and the seduction of riches stifle speech, and he becomes sterile.
That which has been sown in the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who certainly bears fruit and produces, some a hundred times more, others sixty, others thirty. »
He offered them another parable, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
While the people were sleeping, his enemy came and also sowed tares among the wheat, and then he went away.
But when the grass grew and produced grain, the tares appeared too.
The servants of the master of the house came to him and said, "Sir, have you not sown good seeds in your field? Where do these tares come from?
"He said to them, 'It is an enemy who has done this.' The servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and pick them up?"
But he answered, "No, lest by uprooting the tares you uproot the wheat with it.
Let them grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn; but gather the wheat in my barn. »
He offered them another parable, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man has taken and sown in his field,
and which is smaller than all the seeds. But when it has grown, it is taller than the grasses and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come to lodge themselves in its branches. »
He tells them yet another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until all was leavened."
Jesus said all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without parable, he did not speak to them,
that what was foretold by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will reveal things hidden since the foundation of the world. »
Then Jesus sent the crowd away, and entered the house. His disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
He answered them, "He who sows the good seed is the Son of man;
the field is the world; the good seeds are the children of the Kingdom; The tares are the children of the evil one.
The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels.
As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this century.
The Son of Man will send his angels, who will snatch from his kingdom all scandals and those who work iniquity,
and will cast them into the fiery furnace. There will be crying and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let him who has ears to hear hear.
"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man has found and hidden. In his joy, he will sell everything he has and buy this field.
"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant looking for beautiful pearls,
and who, having found a pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.
"Once again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dip net that was thrown into the sea and collected fish of all kinds,
and that, when it was filled, the fishermen brought back to the beach. They sat down and gathered the good ones into containers, but they threw away the bad ones.
It will be the same at the end of the world. The angels will come, will separate the wicked from the righteous,
and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be crying and gnashing of teeth. »
Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered him, "Yes, Lord."
He said to them, "Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasury new things and old things."
When Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there.
When he came to his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "Where do these wisdom and miracles come from?
Is he not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother's name Mary, and his brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?
Are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man find all these things? »
They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his house."
He did not perform many miracles there because of their unbelief.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,
and said to his servants, "This is John the Baptizer. He rose from the dead. That is why these powers work in him. »
For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of Philip, his brother.
For John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have this wife."
As he wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they considered him a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday arrived, Herodias' daughter danced among them and pleased Herod.
He therefore promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
She said, urged by her mother: "Give me here, on a tray, the head of John the Baptist."
The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and those who were at table with him, he ordered it to be given,
and he sent John to be beheaded in the prison.
His head was brought on a tray and given to the young girl, who carried it to her mother.
His disciples came, took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place, out of the way. The crowd, having heard the news, followed him on foot from the towns.
Jesus went out, and he saw a great crowd. He took pity on them and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples came to him and said, "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the crowd away, so that they may go to the villages to buy food. »
But Jesus said to them, "They need not go away. You give them food. »
They said to him, "We have only five loaves and two fish here."
He said, "Bring them here to me."
He ordered the crowd to sit on the grass; then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and raising his eyes to heaven, he blessed, broke, and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the crowd.
All ate and were satisfied. They carried away twelve baskets full of what was left of the broken pieces.
Those who ate were about five thousand men, not counting the women and children.
Immediately Jesus put the disciples in the boat and made them pass before him on the other bank, while he sent the crowds away.
After sending the crowd away, he went up the mountain alone to pray. In the evening, he was there, alone.
The boat was then in the middle of the sea, agitated by the waves, because the wind was contrary.
On the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled and said, "It is a ghost!" and they cried out in fear.
But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Courage! This is me! Don't be afraid. »
Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."
He said, "Come!" Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But seeing that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, seized him, and said to him, "You who are of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
Those who were in the boat came and prostrated themselves before him, saying, "You are truly the Son of God!"
After crossing , they came to the land of Gennesareth .
The inhabitants of that place, having recognized him, sent to all the neighborhoods to bring him all the sick,
and they begged him to allow them to simply touch the fringe of his garment. All who touched it were healed.
Then Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to Jesus, saying,
"Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread. »
He said to them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?"
For God has commanded, "Honor your father and your mother, and, 'Whoever speaks evil of his father or mother be put to death.'"
But you say: "Whoever says to his father or mother, 'The help you could have obtained from me is a gift consecrated to God',
will honor neither his father nor his mother. You have nullified the commandment of God because of your tradition.
Hypocrites! Isaiah has prophesied well about you, saying,
These people approach me with their mouths, and honor me with their lips; but their hearts are far from me.
And they worship me in vain, to teach as a doctrine rules made by men."
He summoned the crowd, and said to them, "Listen, and understand.
What enters the mouth does not defile a man; but what comes out of the mouth defiles the man. »
Then the disciples came and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were scandalized when they heard this word?"
But he replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
Leave them alone. It is the blind who guide the blind. If the blind man guides the blind man, both will fall into a pit. »
Peter replied, "Explain the parable to us."
Then Jesus said, "Do you not understand yet?
Don't you understand that what goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body?
But the things that come out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.
For it is from the heart that evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false witnesses, blasphemies come.
These are things that defile man; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile man. »
Jesus left there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
Behold, a Canaanite woman came out of those borders and cried out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon! »
But he did not answer her a word. His disciples came to beg him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."
But he answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But she came and worshipped him, saying, "Lord, help me."
But he answered, "It is not proper to take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs."
But she answered, "Yes, Lord, but even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done to you as you wish. And his daughter was healed from that hour.
Jesus set out from there and approached the Sea of Galilee; he climbed the mountain and sat down there.
Great crowds came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the dumb, the crippled, and many others, and they laid them at his feet. He heals them,
so that the crowd was in awe when they saw the dumb speak, the wounded healed, the lame walk, and the blind see, and they glorified the God of Israel.
Jesus summoned his disciples and said to them, "I have pity on the crowd, for they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them back on an empty stomach, because they might faint on the way. »
The disciples said to him, "Where can we find so much bread in a desert place to satisfy so great a multitude?"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves have you got?" They said, "Seven, and a few little fish."
He ordered the crowd to sit on the ground,
and he took the seven loaves and the fishes. He gave thanks, broke them, gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.
All ate and were satisfied. They took away seven baskets full of the pieces that remained.
Those who ate were four thousand men, not counting the women and children.
Then he sent the crowd away, got into the boat, and came to the territory of Magdala.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and, after testing him, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
But he replied, "In the evening you say, 'It will be fine, for the sky is red.'
And in the morning, you say, "It's going to be bad weather today, because the sky is red and threatening. Hypocrites! You know how to discern the aspect of the sky, but you do not know how to discern the signs of the times!
An evil and adulterous generation is looking for a sign, and no sign will be given to them except the sign of the prophet Jonah. He left them and went away.
The disciples arrived on the other side and had forgotten to take bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We have not brought bread."
When Jesus saw this, he said, "Why do you reason among yourselves, you people of little faith, because you have not brought bread?
Do you not understand yet, and do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and the number of baskets you have carried away,
or of the seven loaves for the four thousand, and of the number of baskets you have taken away?
How come you don't realize that I didn't tell you about the breads? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. »
They then understood that he had not told them to beware of the yeast of the bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Now when Jesus arrived in the region of Caesarea Philippi, he questioned his disciples, saying, "Who do they say that I am the Son of man?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptizer, some Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for it is not flesh and blood that has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
I also say to you that you are Peter, and that on this rock I will build my church, and that the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. »
Then he commanded the disciples not to tell anyone that he was Jesus the Christ.
From then on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem, that he should suffer much at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and scribes, that he should be killed and that he should rise again on the third day.
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far from you, Lord! This will never be done to you. »
But he turned around and said to Peter, "Go behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you do not meditate on the things of God, but on the things of men. »
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
For what good would it do a man to gain the whole world if he lost his life? Or what will man give in exchange for his life?
For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will repay each one according to his works.
I tell you with certainty, there are some here who will not taste death until they have seen the Son of Man come into his Kingdom. »
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, with him, and led them up a high mountain alone.
He was changed before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as the light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, speaking with him.
Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you will, let us make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. »
While he was still speaking, behold, a luminous cloud covered them with his shadow. And behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen. »
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were very frightened.
Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."
Raising their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
As they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Tell no one what you have seen, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
His disciples questioned him, saying, "Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered them, "Elijah comes first, and he will restore all things;
but I tell you that Elijah has already come, and that they have not recognized him, but have done to him as they pleased. In the same way, the Son of Man will also suffer through them. »
The disciples then understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.
When they came to the crowd, a man came up to him, knelt down and said:
"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers cruelly; it often falls into fire, and often into water.
So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him. »
Jesus answered, "Unfaithful and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you? How much longer shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me. »
Jesus threatened the devil, who came out of him, and the boy was healed at that hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private, and said, "Why couldn't we drive her out?"
He said to them, "It is because of your unbelief. For verily, I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.
But this kind of grain does not come out, except through prayer and fasting. »
While they were sojourning in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men,
they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again. They were extremely sorry.
When they arrived at Capernaum, those who were collecting the didrachm coins came to Peter and said to him, "Does not your master pay the didrachma?"
He answered, "Yes." When he entered the house, Jesus waited for him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive rights or tributes? Of their children, or of strangers? »
Peter said to him, "Strangers." Jesus said to him, "Children are therefore exempt.
But, in order not to trip them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and catch the first fish that comes along. When you have opened his mouth, you will find a piece of stater. Take it, and give it to them for me and for you. »
At that hour the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to himself and placed him in the midst of them
and said, Verily I say to you, unless you are converted and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
Whoever receives such a little child in my name receives me myself,
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a huge millstone hung around his neck and to sink him into the depths of the sea.
"Woe to the world, because of the occasions of falling! For opportunities must come, but woe to him through whom the opportunity comes!
If your hand or foot causes you to trip, cut them off and throw them away from you. It is better for you to enter life mutilated or crippled, than to have two hands or two feet to be thrown into eternal fire.
If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life with only one eye, than to have two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire.
Be careful not to despise any of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
For the Son of Man came to save what was lost.
"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the other ninety-nine, does he not go into the mountain and seek the one that has gone astray?
If he finds it, I tell you truly, he rejoices more than the ninety-nine who have not gone astray.
In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that any of these little ones should perish.
"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his guilt, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have regained your brother.
But if he does not listen, take one or two others with you, so that every word may be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell the assembly. If he also refuses to listen to the assembly, let him be to you as a pagan or a publican.
Verily, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Truly I say to you, if two of you agree on earth to ask for anything, it will be granted to them by my Father who is in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am in the midst of them. »
Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I will forgive him? Up to seven times? »
Jesus answered him, "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
As he was beginning to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
But as he could not pay, his master ordered that he be sold, with his wife, children, and all that he possessed, and that the payment be made.
So the servant threw himself on the ground and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all.
The master of this servant, moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt.
"But this servant went out and found one of his companions in the service who owed him a hundred denarii, and he seized him and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
His companion on duty threw himself at his feet and begged him, saying, "Have patience with me, and I will reciprocate you."
He would not, but he went to throw him in prison until he had repaid what was due to him.
When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply sorry and came to tell their master all that had happened.
His master sent for him and said to him, "Wicked servant! I forgave you all this debt because you begged me.
Ought thou not to have pity on thy companion in service, as I have had pity on thee?
His master became angry and handed him over to the executioners until he paid all that was owed to him.
This is how my heavenly Father will also treat you, if you do not forgive your brother every one of your hearts for his misdeeds. »
When Jesus had finished these words, he left Galilee and entered the territory of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
Great crowds followed him, and there he healed them.
The Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
He answered, "Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female?
and that he said, "Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?"
Thus, they are no longer two, but one flesh. What God has therefore joined together, let not man tear it apart. »
They asked him, "Why then did Moses command us to give him a certificate of divorce and divorce?"
He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except on account of sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her while she is divorced commits adultery. »
His disciples said to him, "If this is the case with a man and his wife, it is not expedient to marry."
But he said to them, "Not all men can receive this word, but those to whom it is given.
For there are eunuchs who are thus born from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have become eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who is able to receive it, receive it. »
Then little children were brought to him to lay his hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, "Leave the little children and do not forbid them to come to me, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to those who are like them."
He laid his hands on them and went away from there.
Behold, someone came to him and said, "Good master, what good must I do to have eternal life?"
He said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one, that is to say, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. »
He said to him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "You shall not commit murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness. »
You shall honor your father and your mother. And you shall love your neighbor as yourself. »
The young man said to him, "I have observed all these things from my youth. What else do I lack? »
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me. »
But when the young man heard this, he went away very sad, for he was a man of great possessions.
Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you for sure, a rich man will find it difficult to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. »
When the disciples heard this, they were exceedingly astonished and said, "Who can be saved?"
Looking at them, Jesus said, "With men it is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered, "Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What will we have? »
Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, who have followed me, in the day of regeneration, when the Son of Man shall be seated on the throne of his glory, you shall also sit on twelve thrones, to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
All those who have left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or a father, or a mother, or a wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundred times, and shall inherit eternal life.
But many will be the last who will be first, and the first who will be the last.
"For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man, master of a house, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
After agreeing with the workmen of a denarius a day, he sent them to his vineyard.
He went out about the third hour, and saw others who were idle in the public square.
He said to them, "Go to the vineyard too, and I will give you what suits you. And they went away.
He went out again about the sixth and ninth hours, and did the same.
About the eleventh hour, he went out and found other idle people. He said to them, "Why do you stay here all day doing nothing?
They replied, "Because no one hired us." He said to them, "You also will go to the vineyard, and you will receive what is right."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager: "Call the workers and give them their wages, from the last to the first.
When those who had been hired about the eleventh hour arrived, they each received a denarius.
When the first arrived, they thought that they would receive more, and they also each received a denarius.
When they had received him, they murmured against the master of the house,
saying, "These have spent only one hour, and you make them equal to us, who have borne the weight of the day and the scorching heat.
"But he answered one of them, 'My friend, I am not hurting you. Have you not agreed with me for a denarius?"
Take what belongs to you, and go away. I want to give to the latter as much as to you.
Is it not permissible for me to do what I want with what belongs to me? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?'
Thus the last will be the first, and the first the last. For many are called, but few are elected. »
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them:
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered up to the chief priests and the scribes, who shall condemn him to death,
and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock him, scourge him, and crucify him; and on the third day he will rise again. »
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling down and asking him one thing.
He said to him, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Order these, my two sons, to sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
But Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? They told him, "We can." »
He said to them, "For you shall drink my cup, and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized; but to sit at my right hand and on my left, it is not for me to give it, but for him for whom it has been prepared by my Father. »
When the ten heard this, they were indignant against the two brothers.
But Jesus called them and said, "You know that the rulers of the nations rule over them, and that their great ones exercise their authority over them.
It will not be so in your midst; but whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant.
Whoever wants to be first among you will be your slave,
as the Son of Man came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. »
As they were leaving Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
And behold, two blind men sat by the roadside, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, sons of David!"
The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out even louder, "Lord, have mercy on us, sons of David!"
Jesus stopped and called to them, and asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him, "Lord, let our eyes be opened."
Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; at that very moment their eyes recovered their sight, and they followed him.
When they approached Jerusalem and arrived at Bethsphage, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
saying to them, "Go to the village in front of you, and you will immediately find a donkey tied up, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.
If anyone says something to you, you will answer, 'The Lord needs them,' and immediately he will send them. »
All this was done in order that what had been foretold by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
"Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King who comes to you, humble, and mounted on an ass, on a colt, the baby of an ass."
The disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, put their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on them.
A very large crowd spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
The crowd that marched before him, and those who followed him, did not cease to cry out: "Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heavens! »
When he arrived in Jerusalem, the whole city was agitated, saying, "Who is this?"
The crowds said, "This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth to Galilee."
Jesus entered the temple of God, drove out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold the doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.'"
The lame and the blind came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
But the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonders he was doing, and the children crying in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the son of David," were indignant,
and said to him, "Do you hear what they say?" Jesus said to them, "Yes. Have you ever read, "Out of the mouths of children and infants have thou shalt forth praise?"
He left them, left the city, and went to Bethany, where he encamped.
In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
Seeing a fig tree by the roadside, he approached it and found only leaves. He said to him, "Let there be no fruit of you forever." Immediately, the fig tree withers.
When the disciples saw this, they were astonished, and said, "How could the fig tree have dried up at once?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you said to this mountain, 'Take yourself and throw yourself into the sea,' it would be done."
Whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive. »
When he had entered the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to him while he was teaching, and said, "By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority? »
Jesus answered them, "I will also ask you a question; if you answer it, I will tell you in the same way by what authority I do these things.
John's baptism, where did it come from? Of heaven or men? They reasoned among themselves: "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Why did you not believe in him?'
But if we say, "Men," we fear the multitude, for all hold John to be a prophet. »
They answered Jesus, "We do not know." He also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
But what do you think? A man had two sons. He came to the first one and said to him, "My son, go and work in my vineyard today.
He replied, "I don't want to," but he changed his mind afterwards and went.
He came to the second, and said the same thing to him. He replied, "I am going, sir," but he did not go.
Which of the two did his father's will? They said to him, "The first . Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, publicans and prostitutes enter the kingdom of God before you."
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the publicans and prostitutes believed it. When you saw it, you didn't even repent afterwards, in order to believe it.
"Listen to another parable. There was a man, master of the house, who planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a hedge, dug a wine press, built a tower, leased it to farmers and left for another country.
When the fruit season approached, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruit.
The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
He again sent other servants, more numerous than the first, and they treated them in the same way.
Then he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son.
But the peasants, seeing the son, said among themselves, "He is the heir." Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and then killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to these farmers? »
They said to him, "He will destroy these wretches miserably, and will rent the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in their season."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone which the builders rejected was appointed at the head of the corner. It came from the Lord. It's wonderful in our eyes"?
"Therefore I say to you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation that produces its fruit.
Whoever falls on this stone will be broken in pieces, but whoever it falls on, it will scatter like dust. »
The chief priests and Pharisees, when they heard his parables, understood that he was speaking of them.
When they sought to seize him, they feared the crowd, because they considered him a prophet.
Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, and said:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a wedding for his son.
He sent his servants to call the guests to the wedding, but they would not come.
He sent other servants again, saying, "Say to those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my meal. My cattle and my fat animals are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast."
But they laughed at it and went their separate ways, one to his farm, the other to his merchandise;
and the others seized his servants, treated them unworthily, and killed them.
When the king heard this, he became angry, sent his armies, put to death these murderers, and burned their city.
"Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy of it.
Go therefore to the crossroads of the roads, and invite to this wedding all whom you find.
These servants went out into the roads and gathered together all those they found, good and bad. The wedding was filled with guests.
But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding clothes,
and he said to him, "My friend, how did you come here without wedding garments?" He remained silent.
Then the king said to the servants, "Bind his hands and feet, take him away, and cast him into the darkness outside. That's when there will be crying and gnashing of teeth."
For there are many called, but few chosen. »
Then the Pharisees went to consult as to how they could trap him in his speech.
They sent their disciples to him, as well as the Herodians, saying, "Master, we know that you are honest and that you teach the way of God in truth, whoever you teach, for you have no bias for anyone.
So tell us what you think. Is it lawful to pay the tax to Caesar, or not? »
But Jesus, perceiving their wickedness, said, "Why do you tempt me, you hypocrites?
Show me the tax money. They brought him a denarius.
He asked them, "To whom does this image and inscription belong?"
They said to him, "To Caesar." Then he said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard him, they were astonished, left him and went away.
On that day, some Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They questioned him,
saying, "Master," Moses said, "If a man dies without having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up offspring to his brother."
Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and, having no descendants, he left his wife to his brother.
In the same way, the second, and the third, up to the seventh.
After all of them, the woman died.
At the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be? Because they all got it. »
But Jesus answered them, "You are in error, you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they do not marry or are given in marriage, but they are like the angels of God in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God has said to you, saying:
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob"? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. »
When the crowd heard him, they were astonished at his teaching.
But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together.
One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him.
"Master, what is the greatest commandment of the law?"
Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest of the commandments.
A second similar commandment is this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments. »
As the Pharisees were gathered, Jesus asked them a question,
saying, "What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him, "From David." »
He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
"The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?
"If, then, David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
No one could answer him a word, and no one dared to ask him any more questions from that day on.
Then Jesus, speaking to the crowd and to his disciples,
said: The scribes and Pharisees sit on the seat of Moses.
Whatever they tell you to observe, observe it and do it; but do not do their works, for they say and do not do.
For they bind heavy burdens that are painful to bear, and put them on the shoulders of men; but they themselves do not lift a finger to help them.
But they do all their works to be seen by men. They widen their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes of their clothes,
they love places of honor in festivals, the best seats in synagogues,
greetings in the public squares, and being called by men "Rebbe, Rebbe.
But you are not to be called "Rabbi," for only one is your master, Christ, and you are all brothers.
Do not call any man on earth your father, for there is only one of your Father, who is in heaven.
Do not call yourselves masters, for only one is your master, Christ.
But the one who is greatest among you will be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, and, to pretend, you make long prayers. That is why you will receive a greater condemnation.
"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you close the kingdom of heaven to men; you do not enter yourselves, and you do not allow those who enter to enter.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel through the sea and the land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes so, you make him a son of Gehenna twice as much as you.
"Woe to you, blind guides, who say: 'He who swears by the temple is nothing; but he who swears by the gold of the temple obliges himself'.
Blind fools! For which is greater, gold or the temple that sanctifies gold?
And: "If anyone swears by the altar, he is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is obliged."
Blind people! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by all that is on it.
He who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who has dwelt in it.
He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits there.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithes of mint, dill, and cumin, and have neglected the gravest things of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. Now, you should have done these things, and not left others in suspense.
Blind guides, you push the gnat and you swallow the camel!
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and iniquity.
Blind Pharisee, first cleanses the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also become pure.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and every kind of impurity.
In the same way, you also appear righteous in the eyes of men on the outside, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous,
and you say: "If we had lived in the time of our fathers, we would not have shared with them in the blood of the prophets."
So you bear witness to yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Fill therefore the measure of your fathers.
Serpents, offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna?
Therefore behold, I am sending you prophets, sages, and scribes. You will kill and crucify some, you will scourge others in your synagogues and you will persecute them from city to city,
so that all the innocent blood shed on the earth may fall upon you, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
Verily, I say to you, all these things will happen to this generation.
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I wanted to gather your children, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!
Behold, your house will be left deserted to you.
For I say to you, you will not see me any more, until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
Jesus left the temple, and set out on his journey. His disciples approached him to show him the temple buildings.
But he answered them, "You see all these things, don't you? Verily, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that is not overthrown. »
As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, and said, "Tell us, when will this happen? What is the sign of your coming and the end of the world? »
Jesus answered them, "Take care that no one leads you astray.
For many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ," and they will lead many astray.
You will hear about wars and rumors of wars. Be careful not to be troubled, for all this must happen, but the end has not yet come.
For a nation will rise up against a nation, and a kingdom against a kingdom; and there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.
But all these things are the beginning of the pains of childbirth.
"Then they will hand you over to oppression and put you to death. You will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
Then many will stumble, give themselves up to one another, and hate each other.
Many false prophets will arise and lead many people astray.
Because iniquity will multiply, the love of many will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in all the world, as a witness to all nations, and then the end will come.
"When, therefore, ye shall see the abomination of desolation, of which the prophet Daniel spoke, standing in the holy place,
let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains.
Let not the one who is on the roof go down to remove the things that are in his house.
Let not the one who is in the field come back to take his clothes.
But woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
Pray that your escape will not be in winter or on the Sabbath,
for then there will be great sufferings, such as have not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.
If those days had not been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But, because of the elected officials, these days will be shortened.
If someone says to you, "Behold Christ" or "Behold Christ," do not believe him.
For false christs and false prophets will arise, who will do great signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
"Behold, I told you beforehand.
If, therefore, it is said to you, 'Behold, he is in the desert,' do not go out; or, "Behold, he is in the inner chambers, do not believe him."
For as lightning comes from the east and shows itself even in the west, so will it be with the coming of the Son of man.
Because where the corpse is, that's where the vultures gather.
"But immediately after the sufferings of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will give its light no more, the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;
and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
He will send his angels with the sound of the trumpet, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
"Now learn this parable of the fig tree: When its branch has become tender and produces its leaves, you know that summer is at hand.
In the same way, you too, when you see all these things, know that he is near, even at the doors.
I tell you with all certainty, this generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
But no one knows that day or hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father alone.
What the days of Noah were will be the coming of the Son of man.
For as in the days before the flood, they ate and drank, and married, and gave in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the boat,
and that nothing was known until the flood came and swept them all away, so it will be with the coming of the Son of man.
Then two men will be in a field: one will be taken and the other will be left.
Two women will grind at the mill: one will be taken and the other left.
Watch therefore , for you do not know at what hour your Lord will come.
But know that if the master of the house had known on what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have allowed anyone to enter his house.
Therefore you also must be ready, for at the hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.
"Who then is the faithful and prudent servant, whom his master has appointed over his house, to give him his food at the proper time?
Happy is this servant whom his master will find doing it when he comes.
Verily, I say to you, he will establish it over all that he possesses.
But if this evil servant says in his heart, "My master is slow to come,
if he begins to beat his fellow servants, to eat and drink with drunkards,
the master of this servant will come on the day when he does not expect it and the hour when he does not know it,
he will tear him to pieces and give him his share with the hypocrites. This is where there will be crying and gnashing of teeth.
"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who, having taken their lamps, went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
The fools, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them,
but the wise took oil from their vessels with their lamps.
While the bridegroom was delaying, they all dozed off and slept.
But at midnight they cried: "Behold! Here is the bridegroom who comes. Go out to meet him!
Then all the virgins got up and prepared their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
But the wise men answered, "What if there is not enough for us and for you? Go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourself.
While they were going to buy, the bridegroom arrived; those who were ready entered with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.
Then the other virgins came also, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us."
But he answered, "Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.
Watch therefore , for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man is to come.
"For it is like a man who, going to another land, called his own servants and entrusted his goods to them.
He gave to one five talents, to another two, to another still one, to each according to his ability. Then he set off.
Immediately the one who had received the five talents went to trade with them, and gained five more talents.
In the same way, he who had received the two talents gained two more.
But he who had received a talent went away, dug in the earth and hid his master's money.
Long after, the master of these servants came and settled his accounts with them.
The one who had received the five talents came and brought five more talents, saying, "Lord, you have given me five talents. Now I have gained five other talents in addition to them'.
His master said to him, "It is good, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a few things, I will confide in you many things. Enter into the joy of your master.
"The one who received the two talents came up and said, 'Lord, you have given me two talents. Now I have gained two other talents in addition to them'.
His master said to him, "It is well, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful for few things. I'm going to tell you a lot of things. Enter into the joy of your master.
The one who had received a talent came and said, "Lord, I knew that you are a hard man, who reaps where he has not sown, and who gathers where he has not scattered.
I was afraid, and I went to hide your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.
"But his master answered him, 'Wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and that I gather where I have not scattered.
So you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and when I returned, I would have received mine with interest.
Take away the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.
For to him that has, and he shall have abundance, shall be given, but to him that hath not, even that which he has shall be taken away.
Cast the useless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he shall sit on the throne of his glory.
All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those who are on his right hand: "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom that was prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
I was naked, and you dressed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me."
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothed you?
When did we see you sick or in prison, and come to you?
The king will answer them, "I tell you the truth, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me."
Then he will also say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels;
for I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
I was a stranger, and you did not take me in; naked, and you have not clothed me; sick, and in prison, and you have not visited me."
"They will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did we not help you?'
"Then he will answer them, 'Truly I say to you, because you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.'
These will go to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life. »
After he had finished all these words, Jesus said to his disciples:
"You know that after two days the Passover will come, and that the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified."
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people met in the court of the high priest, called Caiaphas.
They held a council to seize Jesus by trickery and put him to death.
But they said, "Not during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people."
As Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to him, holding an alabaster vase containing an ointment of great price, and she sprinkled it on his head while he was at table.
His disciples, seeing this, were indignant and said, "Why this waste?
For this perfume could have been sold at a high price and given to the poor. »
But knowing this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good work for me.
For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.
Indeed, by pouring this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
I tell you truly, wherever this Good News is preached in all the world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memory of herself. »
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
and said, "What will you give me if I deliver it to you?" So they weighed thirty pieces of silver for him.
From then on, he looked for an opportunity to betray him.
But on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover for you?"
He said, "Go to the city to someone's house, and say to him, 'The master said, 'My hour is at hand. I will celebrate the Passover in your house with my disciples. »
The disciples did as Jesus had commanded them, and they prepared for the Passover.
When evening came, he sat down to table with the twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said, "I tell you for sure, one of you will betray me."
They were exceedingly saddened, and each one began to ask him, "It is not I, is it, Lord?"
He answered, "Whoever has dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me.
The Son of Man goes as it is written of Him, but woe to the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for this man if he had not been born. »
Judas, who betrayed him, replied, "It is not I, is it, Rabbi?" He said to her, "You said so."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take, eat; This is my body. »
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you,
for this is my blood, the blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many, for the remission of sins.
But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until the day I drink it again with you in my Father's Kingdom. »
After singing a hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all be offended by me this night, for it is written, 'I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
But when I am risen, I will go before you to Galilee. »
But Peter answered him, "Even if all fall because of you, I will never fall."
Jesus said to him, "Verily, I say to you, tonight, before the crows, you shall deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you." All the disciples also said the same thing.
Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and he began to feel sorrow and great anxiety.
He then said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, unto death. Stay here and watch with me. »
He advanced a little, fell on his face, and prayed thus: "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me; However, this is not what I want, but what you want. »
And when he came to the disciples, he found them asleep, and said to Peter, "What, you have not been able to watch with me for an hour?"
Watch and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation. The mind is well disposed, but the flesh is weak. »
A second time he went and prayed, saying, "Father, if this cup cannot pass from me without my drinking it, let your desire be fulfilled."
He returned and found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.
He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.
Then he approached his disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
Get up, let's go. Behold, he who betrays me is very near. »
While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, and with him a great crowd armed with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Now the one who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "He whom I kiss is he. Enter. »
Immediately he approached Jesus, said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came and laid their hands on Jesus, and seized him.
And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword; he struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.
Or do you think that I could not ask my Father, and that he would send me even now more than twelve legions of angels?
How would the Scriptures then be fulfilled that this should be so? »
At that hour, Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you gone out like a robber, with swords and staves, to seize me? I sat in the temple every day to teach, and you did not stop me.
But all this happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.
Those who had taken Jesus took him to the high priest Caiaphas, where the scribes and elders were assembled.
But Peter followed him at a distance to the court of the high priest; he entered and sat down with the officers, to see the end.
The chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false witness against Jesus, in order to put Him to death.
but they found none. They found none. Many false witnesses came forward, but they found none. But at last, two false witnesses presented themselves
and said, "This man said, I can destroy the temple of God, and rebuild it in three days."
The high priest stood up and said to him, "Do you not answer? What are these people who testify against you? »
But Jesus was silent. The high priest answered him, "I adjure you by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus said to him, "You said so. However, I say to you, after this, you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. »
Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, "He has uttered blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? Behold, you have heard his blasphemy.
What do you think? They answered, "He is worthy to die!" »
Then they spat in his face, struck him with their fists, and some slapped him,
saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who struck you? »
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus, the Galilean."
But he denied it in front of them all, saying, "I don't know what you're talking about."
As he had gone out to the portico, someone else saw him and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He again denied it with an oath: "I don't know this man."
After a while, those who were there came and said to Peter, "Surely you also are one of them, for your speech makes you known."
Then he began to swear and curse, "I don't know this man!" Immediately, the crowed.
Peter remembered the words that Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the crows, you shall deny me three times." Then he went out and wept bitterly.
As soon as morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people held a council against Jesus to put him to death.
They bound him, took him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
Then Judas, who was betraying him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, was remorseful, and brought the thirty pieces of silver back to the chief priests and elders.
saying, "I have sinned in giving up innocent blood." But they said, "What does it matter to us? Take care of it. »
He threw the silver coins into the sanctuary and went away. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the silver coins and said, "It is not lawful to put them in the treasury, since it is the price of blood."
They held a council, and with them they bought the potter's field to bury the strangers in.
This is why this field has been called "the field of blood" to this day.
Then was fulfilled what had been foretold by Jeremiah the prophet, in these words, "They have taken the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who had been bought, which some of the children of Israel have prized,
and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me. »
Now Jesus was standing before the governor; and the governor questioned him, saying, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "This is what you say."
When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no reply.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
He did not answer him, not even a word, so that the governor was very much astonished.
Now, on the occasion of the festival, the governor was in the habit of releasing to the crowd a prisoner they desired.
They then had a notable prisoner, named Barabbas.
When they were assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Christ? »
For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had betrayed him.
As he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him to say, "Do not meddle with this righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream for his sake."
Now the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to destroy Jesus.
But the governor replied, "Which of the two do you want me to release you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "What shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?" They all said to him, "Let him be crucified!"
But the governor said, "Why? What harm has he done? But they cried out loudly, saying, "Let him be crucified! »
Then, seeing that nothing was gained, but that on the contrary they were beginning to make a ruckus, Pilate took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. You make sure of it. »
All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"
Then he released Barabbas to them, but he scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified.
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison against him.
They stripped him and clothed him in a scarlet robe.
They plaited a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. They knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spat on him, took the reed and beat him on the head.
After mocking him, they took off his cloak, clothed him in his garments, and took him away to crucify him.
When they went out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they compelled him to walk with them, so that he might carry his cross.
When they came to a place called Golgotha, that is, the place of the skull,
they gave him to drink sour wine mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.
After crucifying him, they divided his clothes among themselves by drawing lots,
and they sat there to look at him.
They put above his head the accusation against him, written: "It is Jesus, the king of the Jews."
And there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
The passers-by blasphemed him, shaking their heads
and saying, "You who destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross! »
In the same way, the chief priests, mocking the scribes, Pharisees, and elders, said:
"He has saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the king of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
He trusts in God. May God deliver him now, if he wills, for he has said, "I am the Son of God."
The robbers also, who were crucified with him, threw the same reproach upon him.
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Some of those who were standing there, when they heard him, said, "This man calls Elijah."
Immediately one of them ran to take a sponge, filled it with vinegar, placed it on a reed and gave it something to drink.
The others said, "Leave him. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him. »
Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.
Behold, the veil of the temple has been torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.
The sepulchres were opened, and many bodies of saints who had fallen asleep were resurrected.
And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many people.
Now the centurion and those who were with him and who were watching Jesus, seeing the earthquake and what was happening, were seized with terror and said, "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
There were many women there who were watching from afar, and who had followed Jesus from Galilee, to serve him.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary, mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
When evening came, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also the disciple of Jesus.
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered the body to be handed over to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean cloth
and laid him in his new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the entrance to the tomb, and went away.
Mary Magdalene was there, with the other Mary, seated in front of the tomb.
The day after the day of preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees assembled to Pilate.
and said, "Lord, we remember what this deceiver, when he was still alive, said, 'After three days I will rise again.'
Command, therefore, that the tomb be placed in safety until the third day, lest his disciples come at night to take him away and say to the people, "He has risen from the dead"; and the last deception will be worse than the first. »
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Come on, secure it as much as you can. »
So they went with the guard and secured the tomb, sealing the stone.
After the Sabbath, as dawn began to break on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone of the door, and sat down on it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his garment white as snow.
Out of fear of him, the guards trembled and became like dead people.
The angel answered the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
He is not here, for he is risen, as he had said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
Go quickly and say to his disciples, "He has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you into Galilee; it is there that you will see him". Here I have told you. »
They quickly departed from the tomb, with fear and great joy, and ran to bring the news to his disciples.
As they were about to announce it to his disciples, behold, Jesus came to meet them, saying, "Rejoice!" They came and took hold of his feet and adored him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers that they must go to Galilee, and there they will see me. »
As they were leaving, behold, guards entered the city and told the chief priests all that had happened.
After meeting with the elders and deliberating, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
saying, "Say that his disciples came by night and carried him off while we were sleeping.
If it comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and free you from all worries. »
So they took the money and did as they were told. This proverb spread among the Jews and continues to this day.
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him; but some doubted.
Jesus came to them and spoke to them thus: "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
Go, make disciples of all nations, baptize them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
and teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age. Amen.
The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you:
the voice of him crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight! »
John came to baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
All the land of Judea and all the land of Jerusalem came to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
John was dressed in camel hair and wore a leather belt at his waist. It fed on locusts and wild honey.
He preached, saying: "After me comes him who is more powerful than I, and whose strap I am not worthy to untie from his sandals.
I have baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit. »
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
As soon as he rose from the water, he saw the heavens split and the Spirit descend on him like a dove.
A voice came out of heaven: "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Immediately, the Spirit pushed him into the desert.
He stayed there, in the desert, forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels served him.
After John was taken into custody, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God,
and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the Good News. »
As he passed along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon's brother, who were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Going a little way from there, he saw James, son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat to repair the nets.
Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hirelings, and followed him.
They went to Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue and taught.
They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
Immediately there was found in their synagogue a man possessed by an unclean spirit, who uttered a cry
saying: "Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus, Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God! »
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"
The impure spirit, which convulsed him and cried out in a loud voice, came out of him.
They were all amazed, and they asked one another, saying, "What is this?" A new doctrine? For he commands with authority even unclean spirits, and they obey him! »
The news of his coming immediately spread throughout the region of Galilee and its surroundings.
As soon as they came out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Now the mother of Simon's wife was sick with fever, and immediately she was told about it.
He came, took her by the hand and made her stand up. The fever immediately left her, and she served them.
In the evening, at sunset, all the sick and those who were possessed by demons were brought to him.
The whole town was gathered at the gate.
He healed many sick people with various diseases and cast out many demons. He did not allow demons to speak, for they knew him.
Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he got up and went out, and went to a lonely place, where he prayed.
Simon and those who were with him were looking for him.
They found him and said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
He said to them, "Let us go elsewhere, to the neighboring cities, so that I may preach there also, for that is why I went out."
He went to their synagogues, throughout Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
A leper approached him, begged him, knelt before him and said, "If you will, you can make me clean."
Moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, touched him and said: "I want it. Be purified. »
As soon as he had said this, the leprosy immediately withdrew from him and he was made clean.
He gave him a strict warning and sent him away immediately,
saying to him, "See that you do not say anything to anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your purification the things that Moses commanded, as a testimony for them."
But he went out, and began to advertise much, and to spread the matter, so that Jesus could no longer enter a city openly, but stood outside, in deserted places. People came to him from everywhere.
A few days after, he again entered Capernaum, and it was learned that he was at home.
Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke to them.
Four people came, carrying a paralytic.
As they could not approach him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. After breaking it, they lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying.
Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven you."
But some of the scribes, sitting there, reasoned in their hearts:
"Why does this man utter such blasphemies? Who can forgive sins if not God alone? »
Immediately, Jesus, seeing in his mind that they were reasoning thus in themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason thus in your hearts?
Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say to him, "Arise, take up your bed, and walk?"
But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic:
I tell you, get up, take your bed and go to your house.
He got up, immediately took the carpet and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like it!"
He went out again to the seashore. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them.
As he passed, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
He was at table in his house, and many publicans and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples, for they were many, and they followed him.
The scribes and Pharisees, seeing that he ate with sinners and publicans, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat and drink with publicans and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are sick. I have come not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. »
John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came to him and asked, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the bride and groom fast as long as the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
No one sews a piece of unsoaked fabric on an old garment, otherwise the piece will shrink and the new one will come off the old one, and the hole is worse.
No one puts new wine in old wineskins, or the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins are destroyed; but new wine is put in new wineskins. »
He was passing through the wheat fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to pluck up the ears.
The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, and those who were with him?
How did he enter the house of God at the time when Abiahar, the high priest, ate the shewbread, which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and gave it also to those who were with him? »
He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.
Therefore the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath. »
He went into the synagogue again, where there was a man whose hand was withered.
They watched him, to know if he was going to heal him on the Sabbath, in order to accuse him.
He said to the man whose hand was withered, "Arise."
He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to kill? But they remained silent.
After looking at them angrily, saddened by the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was made as sound as the other.
The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, in order to destroy him.
Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples. A great crowd followed him, coming from Galilee, from Judea,
of Jerusalem, of Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and of the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon. A great crowd, hearing what great things he was doing, came to him.
He told his disciples to leave a small boat near him, because of the crowd, so that they would not press him.
For he had healed many people, so that all those who had diseases crowded against him to touch him.
The unclean spirits, as soon as they saw him, prostrated themselves before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
He sternly advised them not to make it known.
He went up to the mountain, called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.
He appointed twelve of them, that they should be with him, and that he should send them out to preach
and have the power to heal diseases and cast out demons:
Simon, to whom he gave the name of Peter;
James, son of Zebedee, and John, brother of James, whom he called Boanerges, which means Son of Thunder;
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot;
and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him . Then he entered a house.
The crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat bread.
His friends, when they heard of it, began to seize him, for they said, "He is mad."
The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebub," and "It is by the prince of demons that he casts out demons."
He summoned them together and said to them in parables, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot subsist.
If a house is divided against itself, this house cannot stand.
If Satan has risen up against himself, and if he is divided, he cannot stand, but he has an end.
But no one can enter the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; then he will plunder his house.
"Verily, I say unto you, all the sins of the descendants of man shall be forgiven, including their blasphemies;
but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit has never been forgiven, but is subject to eternal condemnation. »
-because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."
His mother and brothers arrived, and, standing outside, they sent for him.
A crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, "Here is your mother, your brothers, and your sisters looking for you outside."
He said to them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
Looking at those who were sitting around him, he said, "Behold my mother and my brothers!
For whoever does the will of God is my brother, my sister, and my mother. »
He again began to teach by the sea. A great crowd had gathered around him, so that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down. The whole crowd was on land, by the sea.
He taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching:
"Listen! Behold, the farmer has gone out to sow.
As he sowed some of the seed fell along the way, and the birds came to devour it.
Others fell on the rocky ground, where there was little earth, and immediately they grew, because they had no depth of earth.
When the sun rose, she was burned; and as it had no root, it withered up.
Others have fallen among the thorns; the thorns grew and choked him, and he gave no fruit.
Others fell into the good soil and bore fruit, growing and increasing. Some produced thirty times, others sixty times, and others a hundred times more. »
He said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
When he was alone, those who surrounded him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
He said to them, "To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God; but for those outside, everything happens in parables,
so that, seeing , they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, lest they be converted and their sins be forgiven them. »
He said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?
The farmer sows the word.
Those who are by the wayside are those where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that has been sown in them.
In the same way, it is those who are strewn on the rocks, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.
They have no roots in themselves, but they are ephemeral. When oppression or persecution arises because of speech, they immediately stagger.
Others are those who are sown among thorns. These are those who have heard the word,
but the cares of the present age, the seduction of riches, and the lusts that are creeping in, stifle speech, and render it fruitless.
Those who have been sown in good soil are those who hear the word, receive it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, others a hundred times. »
He said to them, "Shall a lamp be brought to put under a basket or under a bed? Isn't it put on a support?
For there is nothing hidden, except to be known, and there is nothing secret, except to be brought to light.
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear. »
He said to them, "Take heed of what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, you will be measured, and more will be given to those who hear.
For he who has, more will be given to him; and he who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him. »
He says, "The kingdom of God is like a man who sows seed on the earth,
who sleeps and rises night and day, and whose seed rises and grows without his knowing how.
For the earth bears fruit of itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the whole grain in the ear.
But when the fruit is ripe, he immediately puts in the sickle, for the harvest has come. »
He said, "How are we going to compare the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we illustrate it?
It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown in the ground, although it is inferior to all the seeds that are found on the ground,
but which, when sown, grows and becomes larger than all the grasses, and grows great branches, so that the birds of the air can dwell under its shade. »
It was by many parables of this kind that he addressed them, according as they were able to hear it.
Without a parable, he did not speak to them, but he explained everything privately to his own disciples.
That day, when evening came, he said to them: "Let us go to the other shore."
Leaving the crowd, they took him with them, as he was, in the boat. Other boats were also with him.
A great storm of wind arose, and the waves struck the boat, until it was already filled.
He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; they woke him up and asked him, "Master, does it not matter to you that we are dying?"
He awoke, threatened the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Rest assured! The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? How come you don't have faith? »
They were seized with great fear, and said to one another, "Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
They came to the other side of the sea, to the land of the Gadarenes.
As soon as he got out of the boat, a man possessed of an unclean spirit came to meet him outside the tombs.
He dwelt in the sepulchres. No one could bind him anymore, not even with chains,
for he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn by him, and the fetters broken into pieces. No one had the strength to tame him.
Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he uttered cries and slashed himself with stones.
Seeing Jesus from afar, he ran to prostrate himself before him,
and cried out with a loud voice, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee by God, do not torment me. »
For he said to him, "Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!"
He asked him, "What is your name?" He said to him, "My name is Legion, for there are many of us."
He begged him very much not to send them out of the country.
Now, on the side of the mountain, there was a large herd of pigs grazing.
All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them."
Immediately, Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs. The herd of about two thousand people threw themselves from the top of the steep shore into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.
Those who had fed the pigs fled and told the city and the country. People came to see what had happened.
They came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac sitting, clothed and sane, even the one who had the legion; and they were afraid.
Those who had seen him told them what had happened to him who was possessed by demons, and what concerned the pigs.
They began to beg him to get away from their region.
As he entered the boat, the one who had been possessed by demons begged him to be allowed to be with him.
He did not allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them of the great things that the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."
He went away, and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him, and everyone was astonished.
When Jesus had crossed the boat again to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him, and he was on the seashore.
And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue arrived, named Jairus. Seeing him, he threw himself at his feet
and begged him much, saying, "My little girl is at the point of death. Come, I pray you, lay your hands on her, that she may be healed and live. »
He went with him. A great crowd followed him, and pressed against him on all sides.
A woman who had had blood loss for twelve years,
who had suffered much at the hands of many physicians, who had spent all she possessed, and who was not cured, but rather who was getting worse,
having heard of Jesus, came behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes.
For she said, "If I only touch her clothes, I will be healed."
Immediately, the flow of her blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was cured of her misfortune.
Immediately, Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out of him, turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who has touched my garments?"
His disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing against you, and you say, 'Who has touched me?'
He looked around to see the one who had done this.
But the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and threw herself on the ground before him, and told him the whole truth.
He said to her, "My daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace, and be cured of your sickness. »
While he was still speaking, people came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the master again? »
But Jesus, having heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Do not be afraid, only believe."
He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John, brother of James.
He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and he saw a tumult, weeping, and great lamentation.
When he came in, he said to them, "Why do you make noise and weep? The child is not dead, but he is asleep. »
They laughed at him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, his mother, and those who were with him, and he went in to the place where the child was lying.
Taking the child by the hand, he said to him: "Talitha cumi!", which means, according to the interpretation, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!"
Immediately the young girl got up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were seized with great astonishment.
He strictly ordered them that no one should know, and ordered that they give him something to eat.
He started from there. He came to his own country, and his disciples followed him.
When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many people who heard him were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get these things?" and "What is the wisdom that has been given to this man, that such works should be accomplished by his hands?
Is it not the carpenter, son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judah and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us? So they were offended by him.
Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, among his relatives, and in his house."
There he could do no powerful work, except that he laid his hands on some sick people and healed them.
He was astonished at their incredulity. He went through the villages teaching.
He called the twelve to him, and began to send them two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
He ordered them not to take anything with them for their journey, except a stick only: neither bread, nor wallet, nor money in their purse,
but to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics.
He said to them, "Where you enter a house, stay there until you come out.
If anyone does not receive you and does not listen to you, shake off the dust that is under your feet, as a testimony against him. Verily, I say to you, on the day of judgment, Sodom and Gomorrah will be more tolerable than that city. »
They went and preached that people repent.
They cast out many demons, and they anointed many sick with oil and healed them.
King Herod heard this, for his name was known, and he said, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and therefore these forces are working in him."
But others said, "This is Elijah." Others said, "He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets."
Herod, having heard this, said, "It is John, whom I have beheaded. He rose from the dead. »
For Herod himself had sent to arrest John and had him bound in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of Philip, his brother, for he had married her.
For John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
Herodias rose up against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not,
for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When he heard it, he did many things, and he listened to it with pleasure.
An opportune day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a supper to his nobles, high officials, and rulers of Galilee.
When Herodias' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those who sat with him. The king said to the maiden, "Ask me what you want, and I will give it to you."
He swore to him, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."
She went out and said to her mother, "What should I ask?" She said, "The head of John the Baptist."
She immediately went in haste to the king and asked him, "I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter at once."
The king was extremely sorry, but out of consideration for his oaths and for his guests, he would not refuse it.
Immediately the king sent a soldier of his guard and ordered John's head to be brought; he went to behead him in the prison,
brought his head back to a tray and gave it to the young woman; and the young woman gave it to her mother.
When his disciples heard this, they came and took his corpse and laid it in a tomb.
The apostles gathered together to Jesus, and they told him all that they had done and all that they had taught.
He said to them, "Go to a lonely place, and rest for a while." For there was a lot of coming and going, and they didn't even have time to eat.
So they set out in the boat, and went alone to a lonely place.
They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They came before them and gathered to him.
Jesus went out and saw a great crowd, and he had pity on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.
As it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, "This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.
Send them away, so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy bread, for they have nothing to eat. »
But he replied, "You give them something to eat." They asked him, "Are we going to buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?"
He said to them, "How many loaves have you got? Go and see. When they found out, they said, "Five and two fish." »
He ordered them to sit in groups on the green grass.
They sat down in rows, by hundreds and by fifty.
He took the five loaves and the two fishes; and raising his eyes to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, which he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among all.
They all ate and were satisfied.
They took twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also fish.
Those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.
Immediately he put his disciples in the boat and took them to the other shore, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the crowd away.
After taking leave of them, he went up to the mountain to pray.
When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on land.
Seeing them in anguish to row, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea; he would have liked to pass near them,
but they, seeing him walking on the sea, thought it was a ghost and cried out;
for all saw him and were troubled. But immediately he spoke to them and said to them, "Courage! This is me! Don't be afraid. »
He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very astonished among themselves, and were astonished at it;
for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
After crossing, they landed at Gennesareth and moored on the shore.
As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized him,
and ran throughout the region. They began to bring the sick on their mats to the place where they had heard that he was.
Wherever he entered, in the villages, in the towns or in the countryside, they deposited the sick in the public squares and begged him to allow them to touch the fringe of his garment; and all who touched him were healed.
Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him.
Now, seeing some of his disciples eating bread with filthy, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.
(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat without washing their hands and forearms, according to the tradition of the ancients.
They do not eat when they return from the market-place, unless they have washed themselves, and there are many other things they have received to keep to it: the washing of cups, jugs, brass vessels, and sofas).
The Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why do not your disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, and eat their bread with unwashed hands?"
He answered them, "Isaiah has indeed prophesied about you, hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.'
They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."
"For you lay aside the commandment of God, and cleave to the tradition of men: you wash pitchers and cups, and do many other things like this."
He said to them, "You have done well to reject the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition.
For Moses said, "Honor your father and mother, and 'Whoever speaks evil of his father or mother be punished with death.'
But you say, "If a man says to his father or mother, 'All that you have been able to receive from me is Corban,' that is, surrendered to God,
"Then you don't allow him to do anything for his father or mother,
thus nullifying the word of God by the tradition you have handed down." You do a lot of things like that. »
He called the whole crowd to himself and said to them, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand.
There is nothing that comes from outside man and enters into him that can defile him; but what comes out of man is what defiles him.
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear! »
When he had entered a house, far from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.
He said to them, "Are you also without understanding?" Do you not understand that what enters man from without cannot defile him,
because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and then into the latrine, which makes all food pure? »
He answered, "What comes out of man is what defiles man.
For it is from within, from the heart of man, that evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, etc.,
lusts, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and folly.
All these evil things come from within and defile man. »
From there he arose and went into the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it, but he could not escape vigilance.
For a woman whose little daughter was afflicted with an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and threw herself at his feet.
This woman was Greek, of Syrophoenician race. She begged him to cast out the demon from his daughter.
But Jesus said to him, "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not proper to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. Yet, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs. »
He said to him, "For this word, go away. The demon came out of your daughter. »
She went to her house, and found the child lying on the bed, the demon having come out.
He again left the territory of Tyre and Sidon, and went to the Sea of Galilee through the middle of the Decapolis region.
A deaf man who had speech difficulties was brought to him. They begged him to lay his hand on him.
He took him away from the crowd, in private, and put his fingers in his ears; then he spat and touched his tongue.
Raising his eyes to heaven, he sighed and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Open up!"
Immediately his ears opened, the impediment of his tongue relaxed, and he spoke plainly.
He commanded them not to tell anyone, but the more he commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed it.
They were extremely astonished and said, "He did everything right. He makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak! »
In those days, when there was a very large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples and said to them:
"I have pity on the crowd, because they have stayed with me three days and have nothing to eat.
If I send them home on an empty stomach, they will faint on the way, for some of them have made a long journey. »
His disciples answered him, "Where can these men be satisfied with bread here, in a lonely place?"
He asked them, "How many loaves have you got?" They said, "Seven."
He commanded the crowd to sit on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. After giving thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.
They also had some small fish. After blessing them, he told them to serve them also.
They ate and were satisfied. They took away seven baskets of the pieces that were left.
Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.
Immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and arrived in the region of Dalmanutha.
The Pharisees went out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven and testing him.
He sighed deeply in his mind and said, "Why is this generation looking for a sign? Verily, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation. »
He left them, and, getting into the boat again, he set out for the other bank.
They had forgotten to take bread, and they had not more than one loaf with them in the boat.
He warned them, saying, "Beware: beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."
They reasoned among themselves, saying, "It is because we have no bread."
Jesus, perceiving this, said to them, "Why do you think it is because you have no bread? Don't you see yet, don't you understand? Is your heart still hardened?
Having eyes, do you not see? You have ears, do you not hear? Don't you remember?
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you take away? They said to him, "Twelve." »
"When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you take away?" They told him, "Seven."
He asked them, "Don't you understand yet?"
He arrived at Bethsaida. A blind man was brought to him, and begged to touch him.
He seized the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village. After spitting on her eyes and laying on her hands, he asked her if he saw anything.
He looked up and said, "I see men, but I see them as walking trees."
Then, again, he put his hands over her eyes. He looked attentively, and, recovered, he saw everyone clearly.
He sent him back to his house, saying, "Do not go into the village or tell anyone in the village."
Jesus went, with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked his disciples, "Who do they say I am?"
They said to him, "John the Baptist, others say Elijah, but still others, one of the prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say I am?" Peter replied, "You are the Christ."
He ordered them not to speak of him to anyone.
He began to teach them that the Son of Man was to suffer much, to be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, to be killed, and to rise again after three days.
He spoke to them openly. Peter took him and began to rebuke him.
But he, turning around and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, "Depart from me, Satan! For you have in view, not the things of God, but the things of men. »
He called the crowd with his disciples and said to them, "Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake and the Good News will save it.
For what good is it for a man to gain the whole world and lose his life?
For what will man give in exchange for his life?
For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. »
He said to them, "Verily, I say to you, there are some here who will not taste death until they have seen the Kingdom of God come with power."
Six days after, Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him, and brought them up to a high mountain, apart, and he was changed into another form before them.
His garments became sparkling, of extreme whiteness, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
Elijah and Moses appeared to them, and they conversed with Jesus.
Peter answered Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. »
Indeed, he did not know what to say, because they were very afraid.
A cloud came to cover them with his shadow, and a voice came out of the cloud: "This is my beloved Son. Listen. »
Suddenly, looking around them, they saw no one with them, except Jesus alone.
As they came down from the mountain, he commanded them not to tell anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
They kept this word to themselves, wondering what this "resurrection of the dead" meant.
They questioned him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
He said to them, "Elijah comes first, and he restores all things. How is it written of the Son of Man that he is to suffer much and be despised?
But I tell you that Elijah came, and that they also did to him as they willed, as it is written of him. »
When he came to the disciples, he saw a great crowd around them, and scribes questioning them.
Immediately, the whole crowd, on seeing him, was very much astonished, and running to him, they saluted him.
He asked the scribes, "What do you ask of them?"
A man of the crowd answered, "Master, I have brought you my son, who has a dumb spirit;
and wherever he seizes him, he throws him to the ground; his mouth is full of foam, grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast him out, and they couldn't. »
He answered him, "Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How much longer shall I bear with you? Bring him to me. »
They brought him to him, and when he saw him, the spirit immediately seized him and he fell to the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.
He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" He said, "From childhood.
Often she threw it both into the fire and into the water to destroy it. But if you can do something, have mercy on us and help us. »
Jesus said to him, "If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes."
Immediately the father of the child cried out, crying: "I believe . Help my disbelief! »
Seeing that a crowd was running, Jesus threatened the unclean spirit, saying to him, "Dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!"
After screaming and subjecting him to strong convulsions, she came out of him. The child became like a dead man, till most of them said, "He is dead."
But Jesus, having taken him by the hand, raised him up, and he arose.
When he entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive her out?"
He said to them, "This kind can only come out by prayer and fasting."
They set out from there and passed through Galilee. He didn't want us to know,
for he taught his disciples, and said to them, "The Son of Man is delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he has been killed, on the third day he will rise again. »
But they did not understand this word, and they were afraid to question him.
He arrived at Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you discussing among yourselves on the way?"
But they were silent, for they had quarrelled on the way about who was the greatest.
He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, let him be last of all and servant of all."
He took a little child and placed him in the midst of them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them:
"Whoever receives such a little child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me does not receive me, but receives him who sent me. »
John said to him, "Master, we have seen someone who does not follow us, who casts out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow us. »
But Jesus said, "Do not hinder him, for there is no one who does a mighty work in my name and who can quickly speak evil of me.
For whoever is not against us is on our side.
For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are of Christ, I tell you with all certainty, he will not lose his reward in any way.
Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea, with a millstone hanging from his neck.
If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter the mutilated life, than to go with your two hands into hell, into the unquenchable fire,
If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life with a limp, than to have both feet thrown into hell, into the fire that is not extinguished,
If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than to have two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire,
"where their worm does not die and where the fire is not extinguished".
For every one shall be salted by fire, and every sacrifice shall be seasoned with salt.
Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its flavor, what will you season it with? Have salt within yourselves, and be at peace with one another. »
He arose from there and came into the territory of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Crowds gathered again around him. As he usually did, he taught them again.
Some Pharisees came to put him to the test, and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
He answered, "What did Moses command you?"
They said, "Moses allowed a deed of divorce to be written and divorced from her."
But Jesus said to them, "It is because of your hardness of heart that he has written this commandment to you.
But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.
Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife,
and the two will become one flesh, so that they will no longer be two, but one flesh.
What God has therefore joined together, let not man separate. »
In the house, his disciples questioned him again on the same question.
He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
If a woman herself divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery. »
Little children were brought to him to be touched, but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, "Let the little children come to me! Do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like them.
Verily, I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child will not enter it. »
He took them in his arms and blessed them by laying his hands on them.
As he was going out of the way, someone ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, "Good master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one: God.
You know the commandments: Do not commit murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not deceive, honor your father and mother. »
He said to him, "Master, I have observed all these things from my youth."
Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him, "You lack one thing. Go, sell all you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me, taking up the cross. »
But at these words his face fell and he went away sad, for he was a man of great possessions.
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter the Kingdom of God!"
The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus spoke again: "Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter the Kingdom of God!
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. »
They were extremely astonished and said to him, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus, looking at them, said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God."
Peter began to say to him, "Behold, we have left everything and followed you."
Jesus said, "Verily I say to you, there is no one who, for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, has left his house, his brothers, his sisters, his father, his mother, his wife, his children, or his land;
but he will receive a hundred times more now, in this time: houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and lands, with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.
But many of the first will be the last, and the last the first. »
They were on their way, going up to Jerusalem; Jesus passed before them, and they were astonished; those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve again, and began to tell them the things that were about to happen to him.
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered up to the high priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the pagans.
They will mock him, spit on him, scourge him and put him to death. On the third day, he will rise again. »
James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said, "Master, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
He said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him, "Grant that we may sit, one on your right hand, the other on your left, in your glory."
But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking for. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? »
They replied, "We can." Jesus said to them, "For you shall drink the cup that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized;
but it is not for me to sit on my right hand and on my left, but for Him for whom it has been prepared. »
When the ten heard this, they began to be indignant against James and John.
Jesus summoned them and said to them, "You know that those who are recognized as the rulers of the nations tyrannize over them, and that their great ones exercise their authority over them.
But it will not be so among you: whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant.
Whoever wants to become the first among you will be the servant of all.
For the Son of Man also came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. »
They arrived at Jericho. As he was coming out of Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the wayside.
When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!"
Many rebuked him, so that he would be silent, but he cried out even louder: "You, son of David, have mercy on me!"
Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." They called the blind man and said to him, "Courage! Stand up. He's calling you! »
He threw off his cloak, jumped up and came to Jesus.
Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said to him, "Rabboni, let me see again."
Jesus said to him, "Go away. Your faith has healed you. Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the way.
When they approached Jerusalem, Bethsphage, and Bethany, to the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples
and said to them, "Go to the village in front of you. As soon as you have entered it, you will find a young donkey tied up, on which no one has sat. Untie it and bring it in.
If someone asks you, "Why are you doing this?" say, "The Lord needs him; and immediately he will send him back here. »
They went away, and found a young donkey tied to the door, outside, in the middle of the street, and they untied it.
Some of those who were there asked them, "What are you doing when you untie the young donkey?"
They answered them exactly as Jesus had said, and they let them go.
They brought the young donkey to Jesus, threw their clothes into it, and Jesus sat on it.
Many hung their clothes on the road, and others cut branches of trees and scattered them on the road.
Those who preceded and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heavens! »
Jesus entered the temple of Jerusalem. After looking at everything, when evening came, he went to Bethany with the twelve.
The next day, when they left Bethany, he was hungry.
Seeing from a distance a fig tree that had leaves, he approached to see if he could not find something there. When he reached it, he found only leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
Jesus said to him, "Let no one ever eat any more of the fruit of you!" and his disciples heard him.
They arrived in Jerusalem. Jesus went into the temple and began to throw out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple; he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold doves.
He did not allow anyone to carry a vessel into the temple.
He taught them, saying, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations?' But you have turned it into a den of thieves! »
The chief priests and the scribes heard him, and they sought how to destroy him. For they feared him, because the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching.
When evening came, he left the city.
As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree dried up to the roots.
Peter, remembering, said to him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has dried up. »
Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.
For I say to you verily, whoever says to this mountain, "Take it away and cast it into the sea," and will not doubt in his heart, but will believe that what he says will come to pass, will obtain what he will say.
Therefore I say to you, that whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and you shall have it.
Whenever you are in prayer, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father, who is in heaven, will also forgive you your transgressions.
But if you do not forgive, your Father who is in heaven will not forgive your transgressions either. »
They returned to Jerusalem. As he walked through the temple, the chief priests, scribes, and elders came to him.
They began to say to him, "By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you the authority to do these things? »
Jesus said to them, "I am going to ask you a question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Did John's baptism come from heaven or from men? Answer me. »
They reasoned among themselves: "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe in him?'
If we say, "Men," they feared the people, for all held John to be a true prophet.
They answered Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
He began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a hedge, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it to a farmer, and went to another country.
When the time came, he sent a servant to the farmer to ask him for his share of the fruit of the vine.
They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.
He sent another servant to them again; they threw stones at him, wounded him on the head, and sent him away shamefully.
He sent yet another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some and killing others.
He had a beloved son left, whom he sent last, saying, "They will respect my son."
But the peasants said among themselves, "He is the heir." Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
They took him, killed him, and drove him out of the vineyard.
What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and he will give the vineyard to others.
Haven't you even read this scripture? "The stone that the builders rejected was appointed to the head of the corner.
It comes from the Lord. It's wonderful in our eyes"?
They sought to seize him, but they feared the crowd, for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them. They left him and went away.
They sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to him to ensnare him with words.
When they arrived, they asked him this question: "Master, we know that you are honest and that you bow to no one; for you have no bias for anyone, but you truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay the tax to Caesar, or not?
Should we give, or not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you try me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it. »
They brought it. He said to them, "To whom does this image and inscription belong?" They said to him, "It's Caesar's."
Jesus answered them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." They were very amazed by him.
Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him. They questioned him, saying:
"Master, Moses wrote to us: 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a woman behind, leaving no children, let his brother take his wife and beget offspring for his brother.'
There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without leaving any descendants.
The second took it, and died, leaving no child behind him. The third did the same;
and the other seven took it and left no children. The last of all women also died.
At the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her for their wife. »
Jesus answered them, "Is it not because you are in error, knowing neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?
For when they rise from the dead, they will not marry or be given in marriage, but they will be like angels in heaven.
But as for the resurrection of the dead, did you not read in the book of Moses, concerning the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob"?
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore seriously mistaken. »
One of the scribes, who heard them discussing together, knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, "What is the greatest of all the commandments?"
Jesus answered, "The greatest is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.
The second is thus conceived: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." There is no other commandment greater than these. »
The scribe said to him, "Truly, master, you have said that he is one and that there is none other than him;
and to love Him with all one's heart, with all one's mind, with all one's soul and with all one's strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. »
Seeing that he answered wisely, Jesus said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." After that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus answered, as he was teaching in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?"
For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."
That is why David himself calls him Lord, how could he be his son? The common people listened to him with pleasure.
In his teaching, he said to them: "Beware of the scribes, who love to walk about in long robes, to be greeted in the public squares,
to have the best seats in the synagogues and the best seats in the festivals,
those who devour the houses of widows, and who, to pretend, make long prayers. These will receive a greater condemnation. »
Jesus sat down in front of the treasury and saw how the crowd was throwing money into the treasury. Many rich people threw away a lot of it.
A poor widow came, and she threw two small pieces of brass, which are equivalent to a piece of quadrans.
He called his disciples and said to them, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow has given more than all those who give to the treasury,
for all have given of their superfluity, but she, of her poverty, has given all that she had to live on. »
As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Master, see what kind of stones and what kinds of buildings!"
Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? There will not remain here stone upon stone, which is not overthrown. »
As he sat on the Mount of Olives, opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately:
"Tell us, when will this happen? What is the sign that all these things are going to come to pass? »
Jesus answered and began to say to them, "Take care that no one leads you astray.
For many will come in my name, saying, "It is I," and they will lead many people astray.
"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be disturbed. For it must happen, but the end has not yet come.
For a nation will rise up against a nation, and a kingdom against a kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and unrest. These things are the beginning of birth pains.
"But take heed of yourselves, for they will give you up to the councils. You will be beaten in the synagogues. You shall stand before rulers and kings for my sake, to bear witness to them.
First of all, the Good News must be preached to all nations.
When you are taken away and handed over, do not worry beforehand and do not premeditate what you are going to say, but say what will be given to you at the same time. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
"The brother shall deliver his brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against the parents and put them to death.
You will be hated by all because of my name, but he who endures to the end will be saved.
"But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, of which the prophet Daniel spoke, standing where it ought not to be" (let the reader understand), "let them that are in Judea flee into the mountains,
and let not the one who is on the roof go down and enter to take anything from his house.
Let not the one who is in the field come back to take his cloak.
But woe to those who are pregnant and those who are breastfeeding in those days!
Pray that your escape does not occur in winter.
For in those days there will be such oppression as there has not been since the beginning of God's creation until now, and never will be.
If the Lord had not shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but, because of the elect whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.
If, therefore, anyone says to you, "Behold the Christ," or "Behold, behold," do not believe him.
For false christs and false prophets shall arise, who shall do signs and wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
But you, watch. "Behold, I have told you everything beforehand.
But in those days, after this oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will no longer give its light,
the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
Then he will send his angels, and he will gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
"Now learn this parable of the fig tree. When the twig has become tender and is producing its leaves, you know that summer is at hand;
In the same way, you too, when you see these things happening, know that it is near, at the gates.
I tell you with all certainty, this generation will not pass until all these things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
But on that day and that hour no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.
Watch, be vigilant and pray, for you do not know when the time will come.
"It is as if a man were going to another country, leaving his house, giving orders to his servants and to each his work, and ordering the doorkeeper to keep watch.
Watch then, for you do not know when the master of the house will come, either in the evening, or at midnight, or at the crowing of the, or in the morning,
lest when he comes suddenly, he should find you asleep.
What I say to you, I say to all: Watch! »
Two days had passed before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and scribes were looking for ways to get hold of him by trickery and put him to death.
For they said, "Not during the festival, for there might be a riot among the people."
While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at table, a woman came, holding an alabaster vessel containing an ointment of pure spikenard, very expensive. She broke the vase and poured some on the leper's head.
But some of them were indignant among themselves, saying, "Why has this perfume been wasted?
For it could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor. So they grumble against her.
But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why bother him? She did a good deed for me.
For you always have the poor with you, and when you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me.
She did what she could. She anointed my body in advance to bury it.
I tell you in truth, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, people will also talk about what this woman did, in memory of her. »
Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to deliver him up to them.
When they heard of this, they rejoiced, and promised to give him money. He was looking for how he could deliver it conveniently.
On the first day of the Unleavened Bread, when the Passover is sacrificed, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He sent two of his disciples and said to them, "Go to the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow
and where he enters, say to the householder, "The master said, Where is the guest room, where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?"
He will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready to welcome us there. »
His disciples went out and entered the city; they found things as he had told them, and they prepared for the Passover.
When evening came, he arrived with the twelve.
As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "I say to you for sure, one of you will betray me, he who eats with me."
They began to be sad and to ask him, one after the other, "Is it not I?" And another said, "It is not I, is it?"
He answered them, "It is one of the twelve, the one who dips with me in the dish.
For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for this man if he had not been born. »
While they were eating, Jesus took bread; and, after blessing it, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "Take, eat. This is my body. »
He took the cup, and, after giving thanks, he gave it to them. They all drank it.
He said to them, "This is my blood, the blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many.
Verily I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again until the day I drink it again in the Kingdom of God. »
After singing a hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.
Jesus said to them, "You will all be scandalized by me this night, for it is written, 'I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
However, when I am resurrected, I will go before you to Galilee. »
But Peter said to him, "Although all are offended, I will not be."
Jesus said to him, "I tell you with certainty, this very day, this night, before the crows twice, you shall deny me three times."
But he spoke all the more: "If I must die with you, I will not deny you." They all said the same thing.
They came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."
He took Peter, James, and John with him, and began to be deeply troubled and afflicted.
He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. Stay here and watch. »
He advanced a little, threw himself on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour would pass away from him.
He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. I beg you, take this cup away from me. However, this is not what I desire, but what you desire. »
He came and found them asleep, and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Couldn't you stay up for an hour?
Watch and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation. The mind is well disposed, but the flesh is weak. »
He went away again and prayed, saying the same words.
He came again and found them asleep, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him.
He returned for the third time and said to them, "Sleep now, and rest. That's enough. The time has come. Behold, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
Stand up! Let's go. Behold, he who betrays me is very near. »
Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd armed with swords and staves, composed of the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
Now the one who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "He whom I am going to kiss is he. Seize him, and lead him to safety. »
As soon as he arrived, he came up to him and said, "Rabbi! Rabbi! and kissed him.
They laid their hands on him and seized him.
But one of those who were there, drawing his sword, struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
Jesus answered them, "Did you go out like a robber with swords and sticks to seize me?
I was with you every day in the temple, teaching, and you did not stop me. But it is in order that the Scriptures may be fulfilled. »
They all left him, and fled.
A young man followed him, having thrown a linen cloth around him over his naked body. The young men seized him,
but he left the shroud and fled naked before them.
They took Jesus to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes met with him.
Peter had followed him at a distance, until he had entered the court of the high priest. He sat with the officers, and warmed himself by the light of the fire.
The chief priests and the whole council were looking for witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.
For many bore false witness against him, and their testimonies did not agree with one another.
Some of them arose and gave false testimony against him, saying:
"We have heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made with hands.'"
Even so, their testimony did not agree.
The high priest stood up in the middle and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What are these people who testify against you? »
But he was silent and said nothing. The high priest asked him again, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
Jesus says, "I am. You will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. »
The high priest tore his garments and said, "What more need do we have of witnesses?
You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think? They all condemned him to be worthy of death.
Some began to spit on him, to cover his face, to punch him, and to say to him, "Prophesy!" The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.
As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the servants of the high priest came,
and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!"
But he denied it, saying, "I do not know or understand what you say." He went out on the porch, and the crowed.
The maid saw him and again began to say to those who were there, "It is one of them."
But he denied it again. After a while, those who were there said to Peter, "You are truly one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your language shows it."
But he began to curse and swear, "I don't know that man you are talking about!"
The rooster crowed. Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the crows twice, you shall deny me three times." When he thought of this, he cried.
In the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the scribes, and all the Sanhedrin, conferred, bound Jesus, took him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" He replied, "That's what you say."
The chief priests accused him of many things.
Pilate asked him again, "Do you not answer? See how many things they testify against you! »
But Jesus answered no more, which astonished Pilate.
Now, on the occasion of the feast, he used to release a prisoner from them, the one they asked him for.
There was a man named Barabbas, connected with his companions in the insurrection, men who, in the insurrection, had committed murder.
The crowd, uttering loud cries, began to ask him to do as he had always done for them.
Pilate answered them, "Do you want me to release the king of the Jews to you?"
For he knew that it was out of envy that the chief priests had betrayed him.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he would release Barabbas to them instead.
Pilate asked them again, "What shall I do to him whom you call the king of the Jews?"
They cried out again, "Crucify him!"
Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they cried out loudly, "Crucify him!"
Pilate, wishing to please the crowd, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, after having caused him to be scourged, to be crucified.
The soldiers took him into the courtyard, which is the praetorium, and they summoned the whole cohort.
They clothed him with purple, and, weaving a crown of thorns, they laid it on him.
They began to salute him: "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They struck his head with a reed, spat on him, and, bending their knees, paid homage to him.
After mocking him, they took off his purple mantle and clothed him in his own garments. Then they led him outside to crucify him.
They compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might carry his cross.
They led him to the place called Golgotha, which is, according to the interpretation, "the place of the skull."
They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it.
After crucifying him, they divided his clothes among themselves, drawing lots for each one to take.
It was the third hour when they crucified him.
The inscription of his accusation was written on him: "THE KING OF THE JEWS."
They crucified with him two robbers, one on his right and the other on his left.
Thus is fulfilled the Scripture, which says, "He was numbered among the transgressors."
The passers-by blasphemed him, shaking their heads and saying: "Ha! you who destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
save yourself, and come down from the cross! »
In the same way, the chief priests, mocking each other and the scribes, said, "He has saved others. He cannot save himself.
Let Christ, the King of Israel, come down from the cross now, that we may see Him and believe Him. Those who were crucified with him also insulted him.
When the sixth hour arrived, there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is the same as saying, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Some of those who were there, when they heard him, said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah."
Someone ran to fill a sponge with vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Leave him. Let's see if Elijah will come to bring him down. »
Jesus uttered a loud cry, and gave up his spirit.
The veil of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
The centurion, who stood opposite him, seeing that he had uttered such a cry and breathed his last, said, "Truly, this man was the Son of God!"
There were also women who looked on from afar, among them Mary Magdalene, Mary, mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome,
who, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him, and many other women who went up with him to Jerusalem.
When evening came, as it was the day of preparation, that is, the eve of the Sabbath,
Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the council, who was also seeking the kingdom of God himself, arrived. He boldly went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Pilate was surprised to learn that he was already dead; and, summoning the centurion, he asked him if he had been dead for a long time.
The centurion having answered him, he gave the body to Joseph.
He bought a linen cloth, lowered the body, rolled it up in the linen cloth and placed it in a tomb hewn in the rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
Mary Magdalene and Mary, mother of Joses, saw where he was lying.
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome bought spices to come and anoint him.
On the first day of the week, very early, they went to the sepulchre at sunrise.
They said to one another, "Who will roll away for us the stone of the entrance to the sepulchre?"
for it was very large. Looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back.
On entering the tomb, they saw a young man seated on the right, dressed in a white robe; and they were astonished.
He said to them, "Do not be surprised. You are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who was crucified. He is risen! He's not here. Look at the place where they deposited it!
But go and say to his disciples and to Peter, "He is going before you into Galilee. There, you will see him, as he told you. »
They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and stupor had seized them. They said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
Now, having risen early in the morning, on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
She went and told those who had been with him, while they were grieving and weeping.
When they heard that he was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe.
After this, it was revealed in another form to two of them, while they were walking, going into the country.
They went away and told the others. Nor did they believe them.
Then he was revealed to the eleven themselves, while they were at table, and he reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after his resurrection.
He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the Good News to all creation.
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
These are the signs that will follow those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak new languages;
they will seize snakes; if they drink anything deadly, it will do them no harm; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will heal. »
And so, the Lord, after speaking to them, was received into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
Since many have undertaken to put in order the narrative of the events that have taken place among us,
As those who from the beginning have been eyewitnesses and servants of the word,
it seemed good to me, having from the beginning followed exactly the course of all things, to write to you in order, very excellent Theophilus,
so that you may know for certain the things in which you have been taught.
There was, in the time of Herod, king of Judea, a priest named Zechariah, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife among the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
They were both righteous before God, walking blameless in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
But they had no children, for Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.
Now, while he was exercising the office of priest before God according to the order of his division,
according to the custom of the office of priest, his lot was to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense there.
All the multitude of the people prayed outside at the hour of incense.
An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the altar of incense.
Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear seized him.
But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your request has been granted. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you will call his name John.
You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall not drink wine or strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, from his mother's womb.
He will bring many of the children of Israel back to the LORD, their God.
He will go before him with the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to prepare a people for the Lord. »
Zechariah said to the angel, "How can I be sure? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years. »
The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I have been sent to speak to you and tell you this good news.
Behold, you will be silent, and you will not be able to speak until the day when these things come to pass, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled in their time. »
The people were waiting for Zechariah and were astonished that he was slow to enter the temple.
When he went out, he could not speak to them. They understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued to make signs to them, and he remained silent.
When the days of his service were fulfilled, he went to his house.
After these days, Elizabeth, his wife, became pregnant, and she hid herself for five months, saying:
"This is how the Lord made me in the days that he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men."
In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee, called Nazareth,
with a virgin promised in marriage to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
After entering, the angel said to him, "Rejoice, you who are so favored! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among all women! »
But when she saw him, she was very troubled by these words, and she reflected on how she could be greeted.
The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and thou shalt give birth to a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his reign. »
Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?"
The angel answered him, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born of you will be called the Son of God.
Behold, Elizabeth, your kinswoman, has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month of her who was called barren.
For nothing that is said by God is impossible. »
Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word. Then the angel walked away from her.
In those days Mary got up and went in haste to the mountain, to a city of Judah,
she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
She cried out in a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
Why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
For behold, when the voice of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped for joy into my womb!
Blessed is she who believes, for the things that have been spoken to her from the Lord will be fulfilled. »
Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord.
My spirit rejoiced in God my Saviour,
for he has looked upon the humble condition of his servant. For from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
For he who is mighty has done great things for me. Holy is his name.
His mercy extends from generation to generation on those who fear him.
He showed strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
He has caused princes to fall from their thrones, and has exalted the humble.
He has filled the hungry with good things. He sent the rich back empty.
He helped Israel, his servant, to remember mercy,
as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his descendants forever. »
Mary stayed with her for about three months, and then she returned to her house.
The time for Elizabeth to give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son.
Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified His mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her.
On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they wanted to call him Zacharias, after his father.
His mother replied, "No, but he will be called John."
They said to him, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name."
They made signs to his father, to know what he wanted to be called.
He asked for a tablet and wrote, "His name is John." They were all amazed.
Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he spoke blessing God.
Fear took hold of all the inhabitants of the neighborhood, and all these words were spoken throughout the mountain of Judea.
All those who heard them fixed them in their hearts, saying, "What will this child be?" The hand of the Lord was with him.
His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he prophesied, saying,
"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited and redeemed his people;
and he raised up for us a horn of salvation in the house of his servant David.
(as he said through the mouth of his holy prophets who have existed since time immemorial),
the salvation of our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us;
to show mercy to our fathers, to remember his holy covenant,
the oath he made to Abraham our father,
to grant us that, delivered from the hand of our enemies, must serve him without fear,
in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our lives.
And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
to give knowledge of salvation to his people through the remission of their sins,
because of the tender mercy of our God, by whom the dawn from above will visit us,
to enlighten those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet on the path of peace. »
The child grew up and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance in Israel.
At that time, a decree of Caesar Augustus provided for the inscription of the whole world.
This was the first inscription made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
They all went to register, each in his own city.
Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, in Judea, to the city of David, called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
to register with Mary, promised to marry him, being pregnant.
While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth.
She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, for there was no room for them in the inn.
In the same country there were shepherds who stayed in the fields and watched over their flocks by night.
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
The angel said to them, "Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news, great joy, which will be shared by all the people.
For a Saviour is born to you this day in the city of David, who is Christ the Lord.
Here is the sign that is given to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a manger. »
Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host who praised God and said,
"Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will towards men".
When the angels departed from them in heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go to Bethlehem, and see what has happened, what the Lord has made known to us."
They came in haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the manger.
As soon as they saw him, they published widely the word that had been spoken to them about this child.
All who heard him were astonished at what the shepherds had said to them.
But Mary kept all these words, meditating on them in her heart.
The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, according to what had been announced to them.
When eight days were completed for the circumcision of the child, he was given the name of Jesus, which had been given by the angel before he was conceived in his mother's womb.
When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
(according to what is written in the law of the Lord: "Every male who opens the bowels shall be called holy to the Lord")
and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord: "A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons."
Behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and pious, he sought the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he was not to see death until he had seen the Christ of the Lord.
He entered the temple by the Spirit. When the parents brought the child Jesus, to act towards him according to the custom of the law,
he received him in his arms, blessed God and said,
"Now thou shalt set thy servant free, O Master, according to thy word, in peace;
for my eyes have seen your salvation,
which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel. »
Joseph and his mother were astonished at the things that were said about him.
Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary his mother, "Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign to be proclaimed.
Yes, a sword will pierce your soul, so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. »
There was a certain Anna, prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of an advanced age, having lived seven years with a husband since her virginity,
and she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who did not depart from the temple, prostrating herself night and day with fasts and supplications.
She went up that very hour, gave thanks to the Lord and spoke of him to all those who were waiting for redemption in Jerusalem.
When they had done all that was in accordance with the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their city, Nazareth.
The child grew and became strong in spirit, he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
His parents went to Jerusalem every year for the feast of Passover.
When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the festival;
and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the child Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother did not know this,
but, supposing that he was in the company, they went a day's journey; and they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances.
Not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.
Three days later, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the masters, listening to them and questioning them.
All who heard him were amazed at his intelligence and his answers.
When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, "My son, why have you treated us like this? Behold, your father and I, we were looking for you impatiently. »
He said to them, "Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house? »
They did not understand the word he was addressing to them.
And he went down with them and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these words in her heart.
And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
during the high priesthood of Anna and Caiaphas, the word of God was addressed to John, son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.
He went throughout the Jordan region, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
As it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord. Make your paths straight.
Every valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be made low. The crooked will become straight, and the difficult paths will be smoothed out.
All flesh will see the salvation of God.'
So he said to the crowd that was going out to be baptized by him, "O races of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, "We have Abraham for our father"; for I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones!
Now also, the axe is at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not produce good fruit is therefore cut down and thrown into the fire. »
The crowds asked him, "What should we do?"
He replied, "Let him who has two tunics give to him who has none. Let him who has something to eat do the same. »
Tax-collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, "Master, what shall we do?"
He said to them, "Do not collect more than is assigned to you."
The soldiers also questioned him, saying, "And we? What should we do? He said to them, "Extort no one by violence, and accuse no one wrongly." Be content with your salary. »
As the people were waiting, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, to know if he was the Christ,
John answered them all, "I baptize you with water, but he comes, mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.
His van is in his hand; he will clean his threshing floor and gather the wheat in his barn, but he will burn the tares in an unquenchable fire. »
Then, with many other exhortations, he would preach the good news to the people.
But Herod the tetrarch, having been rebuked by him on account of Herodias, his brother's wife, and of all the evil deeds he had committed,
added to all these things that he shut up John in prison.
Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized and he was praying. The sky opened,
and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in a corporeal form, like a dove; and a voice came out of heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son. In you I have put all my affection. »
Jesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old; he was the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, son of Eli,
son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai, son of Joseph,
son of Mattathiah, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai,

the son of Amminadab , the son of Aram , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah ,
the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah,

son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.
Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
for forty days, to be tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days. Then, when they were finished, he was hungry.
The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'"
The devil, leading him to a high mountain, showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
The devil said to him, "I will give you all this authority and their glory, for they have been given to me, and I give them to whomever I will.
So if you bow down to me, all this will be yours. »
Jesus answered him, "Go behind me, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve no one but him."
He led him to Jerusalem, placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
for it is written, He will put His angels at your head, to protect you.
and on their hands they shall carry thee, lest thou strike thy foot against a stone. »
Jesus answered and said to him, "It has been said, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"
When the devil had finished all the temptations, he departed from him until another time.
Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news of his coming spread throughout the surrounding region.
He taught in their synagogues, and was glorified by all.
He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, according to his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath, and rose to read.
He was given the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to preach the good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim the liberation of the captives, the recovery of sight for the blind, to deliver the crushed,
and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. »
He closed the book, handed it back to the keeper and sat down. The eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on him.
He began to say to them, "This Scripture has been fulfilled for you today."
All testified to him and were astonished at the gracious words that came from his lips; and they said, "Is not this the son of Joseph?"
He said to them: "You will no doubt say to me this proverb: 'Doctor, heal yourself! All that we heard done in Capernaum, do it also here, in your native city. »
He answered, "Verily, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his native city.
But verily, I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was closed for three years and six months, and a great famine came upon the whole land.
Elijah was not sent to any of them, except to Zarephath in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.
There were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman, the Syrian. »
They were all filled with fury in the synagogue when they heard these things.
They got up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the top of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw him from the top of the cliff.
But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.
He went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. He taught them on the Sabbath,
and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word had authority.
There was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon. He uttered a loud cry,
saying: "Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God! »
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent and come out of him!" When the devil had cast him into the midst of them, he came out of him, without having done him any harm.
Stupor seized all, and they spoke together with one another, saying, "What is this word? For it is with authority and power that he commands the unclean spirits, and they go out! »
The news of his coming spread to all the places in the surrounding region.
He got up from the synagogue and went into Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was stricken with a high fever, and they begged him to help her.
He stood over her and threatened the fever, which left her. Immediately, she got up and served them.
At sunset, all those who had sick people suffering from various diseases brought them to him; he laid his hands on each of them and healed them.
Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" Rebuking them, he did not allow them to speak, for they knew that he was the Christ.
When the day came, he set out and went to an uninhabited place. The crowd sought him, approached him and held him back, so that he would not depart from them.
But he said to them, "I must also preach the good news of the Kingdom of God in the other cities. That's why I was sent. »
He preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
As the crowd pressed him and listened to the word of God, he stood by the shore of the lake of Gennesareth.
He saw two boats on the shore of the lake, but the fishermen had come out and were washing their nets.
He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to get a little away from the land. He sat down and taught the crowd from the boat.
When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Go into the deep water and cast your nets for fishing."
Simon answered him, "Master, we have worked all night and we have taken nothing; but at your word, I will cast the net. »
When they had done this, they caught a great quantity of fish, and their net broke.
They made a sign to their companions in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled the two boats, so that they began to sink.
Simon Peter, seeing this, fell at Jesus' knees, saying, "Lord, depart from me, for I am a sinful man."
For he was astonished, as were all those who were with him, at the catch of fish they had made;
as well as James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were associated with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid. From now on, you will catch people alive. »
When they had brought their boats ashore, they left everything, and followed him.
As he was in one of the cities, there was a man suffering from leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will. Be purified. Immediately, leprosy left him.
He commanded him not to tell anyone: "But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your purification what Moses commanded, as a witness for them."
But the news of his coming spread more and more, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
But he withdrew into the wilderness and prayed.
One of those days, he was teaching. There were sitting Pharisees and doctors of the law from all the villages of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The Lord's power was with him to heal them.
Behold, some men were bringing a paralytic on a cot, and they were trying to bring him in to lay him before Jesus.
Not finding a way to get him in because of the crowd, they went up to the roof of the house and made him go down through the tiles, with his bed, to the middle, before Jesus.
Seeing their faith, Jesus said to him, "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
The scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this who utters blasphemies? Who can forgive sins if not God alone? »
But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why do you reason thus in your hearts?
Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven you," or to say, "Arise and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralyzed, "I say to you, get up, take up your bed, and go to your house."
Immediately he arose in their presence, took what he had laid down, and went to his house, glorifying God.
Amazement took hold of all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, and said, "We have seen strange things today."
After this, he went out and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting in the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me!"
He left everything, got up and followed him.
Levi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and other people who were lying with them.
The scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?"
Jesus answered them, "Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do.
I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance. »
They said to him, "Why do John's disciples often fast and pray, as do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"
He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. Then they will fast in those days. »
He also told them a parable. "No one puts a piece of a new garment on an old garment, or he will tear the new, and the piece of the new will not match the old.
No one will put new wine in old wineskins, otherwise the new wine will burst the wineskins, it will spill out, and the wineskins will be destroyed.
But new wine must be put in fresh wineskins, and both can be preserved.
No man who has drunk old wine immediately desires new wine, for he says, "The old is better." »
Now, on the second Sabbath after the first, he went through the wheat fields. His disciples plucked the ears of corn and ate by rubbing them in their hands.
But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry?
how he entered the house of God, took and ate the shewbread, and gave it also to those who were with him, which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests alone? »
He answered them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
On another Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, whose right hand was withered.
The scribes and Pharisees watched him, to see if he would do a healing on the Sabbath, in order to find an accusation against him.
But Jesus knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, "Arise and stand in the middle." He got up and stood up.
Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you a question: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil? To save a life, or to kill? »
He looked at them all, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was made as sound as the other.
But they were filled with rage, and they talked among themselves about what they could do to Jesus.
In those days he went to the mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night praying to God.
When the day came, he called his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom he also called apostles:
Simon, whom he also called Peter; André, his brother; Jacob; John; Philippe; Barthélemy;
Matthew; Thomas; James, son of Alphaeus; Simon, called the Zealot;
Judas, son of James; and Judas Iscariot , who also became a traitor .
He went down with them and stood on level ground, in company with a crowd of his disciples and a great number of people from all Judea, from Jerusalem and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases,
as well as of those who were tormented by unclean spirits; and they were healed.
The whole crowd tried to touch him, for a force came out of him and healed them all.
He lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, "Blessed are you who are poor, for the kingdom of God is yours.
Blessed are those who are hungry now, for you will be fulfilled. Blessed are you who are weeping now, for you will laugh.
Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and mock you, and cast your name to pasture for the Son of Man's sake.
Rejoice in that day and rejoice, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same to the prophets.
"But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.
Woe to you, who are now satisfied, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
Woe to men, when men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.
"But I say to you, who listen to me, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.
To the one who strikes you on the cheek, present the other also; and to him who takes your cloak from you, do not also refuse your tunic.
Give to whoever asks you, and do not ask him who deprives you of your goods to give them back to you.
"As you want people to do to you, do the exact same thing to them.
"If you love those who love you, how does that honor you? For even sinners love those who love them.
If you do good to those who do you good, what honor does it do you? For even sinners do the same.
If you lend to those you hope to receive, what merit do you have? Sinners themselves lend to sinners, to receive as much in return.
But love your enemies, do good, lend without expecting anything in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be the children of the Most High, for he is good to the ungrateful and the wicked.
"Be merciful, therefore, as your Father is also merciful.
Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Free yourself, and you will be free.
"Give, and it will be given to you: you will be given a good measure, packed, shaken and overflowing. For it is with the same measure that you measure that you will be measured. »
He addressed them a parable. "Can a blind man guide a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?
A disciple is not above his master, but each one, when he is well formed, will be like his master.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do you not consider the beam in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother, "My brother, let me remove the speck that is in your eye," when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your eye? Hypocrite! First remove the beam from your eye, and then you will be able to see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother's eye.
"For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor a rotten tree that produces good fruit.
For each tree is recognized by its fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor grapes from a thorn bush.
The good man draws from the good treasury of his heart what is good, and the evil man draws from the evil treasure of his heart what is evil, for it is from the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks.
Why do you call me, "Lord, Lord," and do not do what I say?
Whoever comes to me, hears my words and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.
He is like a man who builds a house, who has dug and deepened, and who has laid the foundation on the rock. When there was a flood, the torrent rushed against this house and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.
But he who hears and does not do is like a man who built a house on the earth without foundation, against which the torrent broke, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of this house was great. »
When he had finished speaking in the ear of the people, he entered Capernaum.
The servant of a centurion, who was dear to him, was sick and on the point of death.
When he heard of Jesus, he sent him elders of the Jews, begging him to come and save his servant.
When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, "It is worthy that you should do this for him,
for he loves our nation, and it is for us that he has built our synagogue. »
Jesus went with them. As he was not far from home, the centurion sent him some friends to say, "Lord, do not worry yourself, for I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.
That is why I did not even think myself worthy to come and see you; but speak the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I too am a man under authority, having soldiers under my command. I said to one, "Go," and he goes; to another, "Come," and he comes; to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard these things, he was astonished at him, and then he turned around and said to the crowd that followed him, "I say to you, I have not found so great faith, not even in Israel."
Those who had been sent, having returned home, found that the servant who had been sick was healed.
Soon after, he went to a city called Nain. Several of his disciples, as well as a great crowd, accompanied him.
As he approached the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was carried away, the only son of his mother, who was a widow. Many people from the city were with her.
The Lord, when he saw her, took pity on her and said to her, "Do not weep."
He approached and touched the coffin, and the pallbearers stopped. He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise!"
The one who was dead stood up and began to speak. Then he entrusted him to his mother.
All were seized with fear and glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us" and "God has visited his people."
This news spread about him throughout Judea and the surrounding region.
John's disciples told him all these things.
John, having called two of his disciples to him, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you the one who is coming, or must we seek another?"
The men came to him and said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you the one who is coming, or are we to look for another?'
In that hour he healed many diseases, plagues, and evil spirits, and restored sight to many blind men.
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: that the blind may receive their sight, that the lame may walk, that the lepers may be cleansed, that the deaf may hear, that the dead may be raised, and that the good news be preached to the poor.
Happy is he who finds in me no occasion to fall! »
When John's messengers had gone, he began to say to the crowd about John, "What have you gone to see in the wilderness? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what did you go to see? A man dressed in a soft garment? Behold, those who are magnificently dressed and live in delicacy are in the courts of kings.
But you, what did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.
It is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way before you.
"For I say unto you, among those born of women there is no greater prophet than John the Baptizer; and he who is the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. »
When all the people and publicans heard this, they declared that God is righteous, having been baptized by the baptism of John.
But the Pharisees and the jurists rejected the counsel of God, not having themselves been baptized by him.
So what should I compare the people of this generation to? What do they look like?
They are like children sitting in the market place, calling out to each other, saying, 'We whistled for you, and you did not dance. We lamented, and you did not weep.
For John the Baptist did not come to eat bread or drink wine, and you say, "He has a demon."
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, "Behold a glutton and a drunkard, the friend of publicans and sinners."
Wisdom is justified by all its children. »
One of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He went into the house of the Pharisee and sat down to table.
And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, knowing that he was lying in the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster vessel filled with incense.
Standing behind at her feet weeping, she began to wet her feet with her tears, wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed her feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
The Pharisee who had invited him, seeing this, said to himself, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have understood who and what kind of woman it is who touches him, that she is a sinner."
Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." He said, "Master, speak."
"A certain lender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
As they could not pay, he forgave them both. Which of them will love him the most? »
Simon answered, "The one, I suppose, whom he has forgiven the most." He said to him, "You have judged rightly."
Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house, and you did not give me water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.
You didn't give me a kiss, but she, since I entered, hasn't stopped kissing my feet.
You have not anointed my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.
Therefore I tell you that her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little. »
He said to him, "Your sins are forgiven."
Those who were at table with him began to say to themselves, "Who is this, who forgives even sins?"
He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace. »
Soon after, he traveled through the towns and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. He had with him the twelve,
and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had issued,
Jeanne, wife of Chuzas, steward of Herod, Susanna, and several others who served them with their property.
When a great crowd was assembled, and people from all the cities came to him, he spoke in a parable:
"The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed , some of the seed fell along the way; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air devoured it.
Another part of the seed fell on the rock; no sooner had it grown than it dried up, for lack of moisture.
Another fell in the midst of thorns; the thorns grew with her and choked her.
Another fell into good soil; it has grown and given a hundred times more fruit. Saying this, he cried out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." »
Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"
He said, "It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to others it has been given in parables, so that when they see they do not see and when they hear they do not understand.
"This is the parable: The seed is the word of God.
Those who are on the way are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they do not believe and are not saved.
Those who are on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a time, then fall at the moment of temptation.
Those who have fallen among thorns are those who have heard the word, but who, as they go on their way, are choked by the cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and they do not bear fruit when ripe.
Those who are in good soil are those who, with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold fast to it and bear fruit with perseverance.
No one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a container or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.
For there is nothing hidden that should not be revealed, nor secret that should not be known and brought to light.
Be careful, therefore, in the manner in which you hear. For he who has, it will be given to him; and he who has not, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him. »
His mother and brothers came to see him, but they could not approach him because of the crowd.
Some people said to him, "Your mother and brothers are outside, they want to see you."
But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are the ones who hear the word of God and do it."
One of these days he and his disciples got into a boat and said to them, "Let us go to the other side of the lake." So they got into the water.
But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A windstorm hit the lake, and they took a dangerous amount of water.
They came up to him and woke him up, saying, "Master, Master, we are dying." He awoke and threatened the wind and the raging of the water; then they ceased, and calm returned.
He said to them, "Where is your faith?" They were frightened, and were astonished, and said to one another, "Who is this, that he should command even the winds and the waters, and that they should obey him?"
They then came to the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
When Jesus dismounted, a man from the city who had had demons for a long time came to meet him. He wore no clothes, and did not dwell in a house, but in tombs.
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, prostrated himself before him, and said in a loud voice, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torment me! »
For Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of this man. For the unclean spirit had often taken possession of this man. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters. By breaking the bonds, he was driven by the demon into the desert.
Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into him.
They begged him not to order them to go into the abyss.
Now there was a herd of many pigs grazing on the mountain, and they begged him to allow them to enter them. And he allowed them to do so.
The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed from the top of the steep shore into the lake and was drowned.
When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the countryside.
People came out to see what had happened. They approached Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and sane; and they were afraid.
Those who had seen this told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed.
All the inhabitants of the surrounding country, the Gadarenes, begged him to get away from them, for they were very afraid. Then he got into the boat and returned.
The man from whom the demons had come begged him to accompany him, but Jesus sent him away, saying:
"Return to your house, and declare the great things that God has done for you." He went away, proclaiming throughout the city the great things that Jesus had done for him.
When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for all were waiting for him.
Behold, a man named Jairus arrives. He was a ruler of the synagogue. He threw himself at Jesus' feet and begged him to enter his house,
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. But, as he was leaving, the crowd pressed against him.
A woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her money on doctors and who could not be cured by any of them,
came behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. Immediately, the flow of his blood stopped.
Jesus said, "Who has touched me?" When all denied it, Peter and those who were with him said, "Master, the crowd is pressing and pushing you, and you say, 'Who has touched me?'
But Jesus said, "Someone has touched me, for I saw that power had gone out of me."
The woman, seeing that she was not hidden, came trembling; and, throwing herself on the ground before him, she told him, in the presence of everyone, the reason why she had touched him, and how she had been healed immediately.
He said to her, "My daughter, rejoice. Your faith has healed you. Go in peace. »
While he was still speaking, someone from the house of the ruler of the synagogue came to him and said, "Your daughter is dead. Do not disturb the master. »
But Jesus, hearing him, answered him, "Do not be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed. »
When he arrived at the house, he let no one in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child and his mother.
Everyone was crying and crying for her. But he said, "Don't cry. She is not dead, but she is asleep. »
They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
But he brought them all out, and, taking her by the hand, he called to her, saying, "Child, arise!"
Her mind returned, and she immediately got up. He ordered that he be given something to eat.
His parents were stunned, but he ordered them not to tell anyone anything about what had happened.
He summoned the twelve and gave them power to overcome all demons and heal diseases.
He sent them to preach the Kingdom of God and heal the sick.
He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey: neither stick, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money. Do not have two tunics each.
In whatever house you enter, stay there, and leave it.
All those who do not receive you, when you leave this city, shake off even the dust from your feet, as a witness against them. »
They set out and went through the villages, preaching the Good News and healing everywhere.
Herod the tetrarch heard all that he had done, and he was greatly troubled, because some said that John had risen from the dead.
others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the ancient prophets had risen.
Herod said, "I have beheaded John, but who is this of whom I hear so much?" He tried to see him.
The apostles, on their return, told him what they had done. He took them and withdrew to a lonely place, to a city called Bethsaida.
But the crowd, perceiving this, followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and healed those who needed to be healed.
The day was beginning to fall; the twelve came and said to him, "Send the crowd away, that they may go to the villages and farms round about, and that they may lodge and get food, for we are here in a lonely place."
But he said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people."
For they were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, "Have them sit in groups of about fifty each."
They did so, and made them all sit down.
He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and, raising his eyes to heaven, blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to present to the crowd.
They ate and were all satisfied. They picked up the twelve baskets of pieces that were left.
As he was praying alone, the disciples were near him, and he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
They answered, "John the Baptizer, but others say, Elijah, and still others, that one of the ancient prophets has risen."
He said to them, "But who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."
But he warned them and commanded them not to tell anyone,
saying, "The Son of Man must suffer much, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and rise again on the third day."
He said to all, "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
For what good does it profit a man to gain the whole world, if he loses or denies himself?
For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him, when he comes in his glory, and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
But I tell you the truth: among those who stand here, there are some who will not taste death until they have seen the Kingdom of God. »
About eight days after these words, he took Peter, John, and James with him, and went up to the mountain to pray.
As he prayed, the aspect of his face changed, and his garments became white and dazzling.
And behold, two men were conversing with him, who were Moses and Elijah,
who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
Now Peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep; but, when they were fully awakened, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.
As they parted from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah," without knowing what he was saying.
As he said this, a cloud came over them, and they were afraid when they entered the cloud.
A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son. Listen! »
When the voice was heard, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one at that time what they had seen.
The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd came to meet him.
And behold, a man of the crowd cried out, "Master, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
Behold, a spirit seizes him, he suddenly cries out, convulses him to the point of foaming at him, and as soon as he leaves him, he bruises him gravely.
I begged your disciples to cast him out, and they could not. »
Jesus answered, "Unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here. »
As he was still approaching, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him violently. But Jesus threatened the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and returned him to his father.
They were all amazed at the majesty of God. When all marveled at all the things Jesus did, he said to his disciples:
"Let these words penetrate your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
But they did not understand this word. It was hidden from them, so that they would not perceive it, and they were afraid to question him about this word.
A dispute arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.
Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, placed him by his side,
and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. And he who receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is the least of you all, he will be great. »
John answered, "Master, we have seen someone who casts out demons in your name, and we have forbidden him to do so, because he does not follow us."
Jesus said to him, "Do not hinder him, for he who is not against us is for us."
As the days when he was to be carried off were at hand, he prepared to go to Jerusalem
and sent messengers before him. They went and entered a village of the Samaritans, in order to prepare to receive him.
They did not receive him, because he traveled with his face turned towards Jerusalem.
When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, as Elijah did?"
But he turned around and rebuked them, "You don't know what spirit you are of.
For the Son of Man did not come to destroy the lives of men, but to save them. They went to another village.
As they went on their way, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go, Lord."
Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
He said to another, "Follow me!" But he said, "Lord, let me go and bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the Kingdom of God."
Another also said, "I want to follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to those who are with me."
But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God."
Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two before him to all the cities and places where he was about to come.
Then he said to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send laborers into his harvest.
Go this way. Behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
Do not wear purses, purses, or sandals. Do not greet anyone on the way.
In whatever house you enter, say first, "Peace be with this house."
If there is a son of peace there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will come back to you.
Stay in this same house, eat and drink what is given you, for the worker deserves his wages. Don't go from house to house.
In whatever city you enter and where you are received, eat what is presented to you.
Heal the sick who are there and say to them: "The Kingdom of God has drawn near to you."
But in whatever city you enter, and where you are not received, go out into its streets and say:
"We wipe against you the dust of your city that has clung to us. But know that the Kingdom of God has drawn near to you."
I tell you, on that day it will be more bearable for Sodom than for this city.
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done among you had been done at Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting on sackcloth and ashes.
But, in judgment, Tyre and Sidon will be more tolerable than you.
You, Capernaum, who are lifted up to heaven, will be humbled to hell.
Whoever hears you hears me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. He who rejects me rejects the one who sent me. »
The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"
He said to them, "I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
Behold, I give you power to walk on serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy. Nothing can hurt you.
However, do not rejoice that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. »
At that same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, "I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and have revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for thus he has been pleasing in your sight. »
Turning to the disciples, he said, "All things have been given to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, if not the Father, and who the Father is, if not the Son, and the one to whom the Son wishes to reveal him. »
Turning to the disciples, he said to them privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see the things you see,
for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which you see, and have not seen them, and have not heard the things which you hear, and have not heard them. »
Behold, a doctor of the law arose and tested him, saying, "Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it? »
He answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself."
He said to him, "You answered well. Do this, and you will live. »
But he, wishing to justify himself, asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"
Jesus answered, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. He fell into the midst of brigands who stripped him, beat him, and then went away, leaving him half dead.
By chance, a priest was coming down there. He saw it and went to the other side.
In the same way, a Levite, who had arrived at this place and had seen it, passed over to the other side.
But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came to where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion,
approached him, dressed his wounds, and poured out oil and wine. He put him on board his own beast, took him to an inn, and took care of him.
The next day, as he was leaving, he took two denarii, gave them to the host, and said to him, "Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will give you back when I return."
Now, which of these three do you think is the neighbor of him who fell in the midst of the robbers? »
He said, "He that had mercy on him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do the same."
As they continued their way, he entered a village, and a woman, named Martha, received him in her house.
She had a sister, named Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and listened to His word.
But Martha, distracted by the service, came to Jesus and said to him, "Lord, do you not care that my sister left me alone to serve? Ask him to help me. »
Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled by many things,
but only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her. »
When he was finishing his prayers in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."
He said to them, "When you pray, say, 'Our Father who is in heaven, let your name be kept holy. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us day after day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive all those who are indebted to us. Do not subject us to temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. »
He said to them, "Which of you, if he goes to a friend at midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves,
for a friend of mine came to see me on his return from a journey, and I have nothing to present to him,
and the one inside will answer, "Do not disturb me. The door is now closed, and my children are lying with me. I can't stand up and give it to you"?
I tell you, even if he will not get up to give it to her because he is her friend, he will get up, because of her obstinacy, and give her as much as he needs.
"I say to you, keep asking, and it will be given to you. Always search, and you will find . Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.
For whoever asks receives . He who seeks finds . To the one who knocks, we open it.
"Which of you, fathers, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he not give him a serpent instead of a fish?
Or if he asks for an egg, he won't give him a scorpion, right?
If, then, you, who are evil, know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him. »
He was casting out a demon, and this man was dumb. When the demon had come out, the dumb man spoke, and the crowd was astonished.
But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons."
Others, testing him, expected him to be a sign from heaven.
But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is devastated. A house divided against itself falls.
If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebub that I cast out demons.
But if it is by Beelzebub that I cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? That is why they will be your judges.
But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, it is because the Kingdom of God has come to you.
"When a strong, well-armed man guards his own home, his property is safe.
But when someone stronger attacks him and defeats him, he takes away all the armor in which he trusted, and divides his booty.
"Whoever is not with me is against me. He who does not assemble with me scatters.
The impure spirit, when it has gone out of man, passes through arid places, seeking rest; and finding none, he said, "I will return to my house from which I came.
When he returns, he finds it swept and put away.
Then he goes and takes seven other spirits worse than himself, and they enter and dwell there. This man's last state becomes worse than the first. »
As he spoke thus, a woman of the crowd raised her voice and said to him, "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that suckled you!"
But he says, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it."
As the crowds gathered around him, he began to say, "This generation is bad. She is looking for a sign. He will be given no other sign than the sign of Jonah the prophet.
For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.
The queen of the south will rise up in the tribunal with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she has come from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, there is here a greater man than Solomon.
The men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment with the men of this generation and condemn it, for they have repented at Jonah's preaching; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
"No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.
The lamp of the body is the eye. Wherefore, when thy eye is good, thy whole body is also full of light; but when it is bad, your body is also full of darkness.
See, then, if the light that is in you is not darkness.
If, therefore, your whole body is full of light, having no dark part, it will be entirely full of light, as when the lamp, by its brightness, illuminates you. »
As he spoke, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He entered and sat down to table.
When the Pharisee saw him, he was surprised that he had not first washed himself before dinner.
The Lord said to him, "You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but your inside is full of robbery and wickedness.
Fools, did not he who made the outside also make the inside?
But give to the needy what is within, and behold, all things will be pure for you.
But woe to you, Pharisees! For you pay tithes of mint, of the street, and of all herbs, but you disregard the justice and love of God. You should have done both of these things, and not left the other in abeyance.
Woe to you, Pharisees! Because you love the best seats in synagogues and greetings in market places.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the men who walk on them do not know it. »
One of the lawyers replied: "Master, by saying this, you are insulting us too."
He said: "Woe to you too, lawyers! For you burden men with burdens that are difficult to bear, and you yourselves lift not a finger to help bear these burdens.
Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, whom your fathers slain.
In this way you bear witness and consent to the works of your fathers. For they have killed them, and you are building their tombs.
Therefore the wisdom of God has said, "I will send them prophets and apostles, and they will kill and persecute some of them,
that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation,
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary." Yes, I tell you, it will be demanded of this generation.
Woe to you, lawyers! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You did not enter yourselves, and those who did enter you prevented them. »
When he said this to them, the scribes and Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things from him.
lying in wait for him and trying to catch him in something he could say, in order to accuse him.
Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered together, to the point of trampling on one another, he began to say to his disciples, first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
But there is nothing hidden that is not revealed, nor concealed that is not known.
Therefore all that you have said in darkness will be heard in the light. What you have said in your ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the rooftops.
"I say to you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body and who, after that, have nothing more to do.
But I will warn you who you should be afraid of. Fear him who, after having killed, has the power to throw into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear it.
"Aren't five sparrows sold for two pieces of assaria? None of them is forgotten by God.
But all the hairs on your head are counted. So don't be afraid. You are more valuable than many sparrows.
"I say to you, whoever confesses me before men, the Son of Man will also confess him before the angels of God;
but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
When you are brought before the synagogues, the magistrates and the authorities, do not worry about what you will answer or say;
for the Holy Spirit will teach you at this very hour what you must say. »
A man of the crowd said to him, "Master, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me."
But he said to him, "Man, who has made me judge or arbiter over you?"
He said to them, "Beware! Beware of covetousness, for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of things he possesses. »
He addressed them a parable, saying: "The land of a rich man produced in abundance.
He reasoned to himself, saying, "What am I going to do, for I have no room to store my crops?"
He replied, "This is what I am going to do. I will demolish my barns, I will build larger ones, and I will store all my grain and my goods in them.
I will say to my soul: "Soul, you have many possessions accumulated for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry. »'
But God said to him: "Fool, this evening, your soul is being asked for. The things you have prepared, to whom will they belong?
It is the same with him who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich in the sight of God. »
He said to his disciples, "Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will wear.
Life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
Consider the crows: they do not sow, they do not reap, they have neither barns nor stables, and God feeds them. How much more precious you are than birds!
Which of you, by worrying, can add a cubit to his size?
If, then, you are not able to do the least things, why do you worry about the rest?
Consider the lilies, how they grow. I tell you, Solomon himself, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of them.
But if this is how God dresses the grass of the field, which exists today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, people of little faith?
"Do not seek what you will eat or drink, and do not worry.
For the nations of the world seek all these things, but your Father knows that you need them.
Seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be given to you as well.
"Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.
Sell what you have and donate to the needy. Make for yourselves purses that do not grow old, an unalterable treasure in the heavens, where no thief approaches and where no moth destroys.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart also be.
"Let your waist be clothed and your lamps lighted.
Be like men who watch for their master when they return from the wedding, so that when he comes knocking, they will open it for him at once.
Happy are those servants whom the master will find watching when he comes. I tell you for sure, he will dress himself, make them lie down and come and serve them.
They will be blessed if he comes on the second or third watch and finds them so.
But know that if the master of the house had known at what time the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have allowed anyone to enter his house.
Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you are not expecting him. »
Peter said to him, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"
The Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and discreet steward whom his master shall appoint over his house, to give him his share of food at the proper time?
Happy is this servant whom his master will find doing this when he comes.
Truly I say to you, he will establish it over all that he possesses.
But if that servant says in his heart, "My master is slow to come," and begins to beat the servants and maidservants, to eat, to drink, and to get drunk,
The master of this servant will come on the day when he does not expect him, and at the hour he does not know, he will cut him in two and put his share with the infidels.
The servant who knew the will of his master and did not prepare and did not do what he wanted, will be beaten with many blows;
but he who did not know, and who has done things worthy of blows, will be beaten with few blows. Of him to whom much has been given, much will be asked; and of him to whom much has been entrusted, more will be asked.
"I have come to cast fire on the earth. I would like it to be already on.
But I have a baptism to receive, and how I grieve until it is accomplished!
Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.
For henceforth, in the same house, there will be five people divided, three against two, and two against three.
They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. »
He also said to the crowd, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, 'There is going to be a shower,' and it happens.
When a south wind blows, you say, "There will be scorching heat," and it happens.
Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the aspect of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you do not interpret this time?
"Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
For when you go with your adversary before the magistrate, strive on the way to free yourself from him, lest he drag you before the judge, the judge deliver you up to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
I tell you, you will not get out of there until you have paid every penny. »
Some of them, who were present at the same time, told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?
I tell you, no; but if you do not repent, you will all perish in the same way.
Or do you think that those eighteen people on whom the tower of Siloam fell and killed them, were they worse sinners than all the inhabitants of Jerusalem?
I tell you, no, but if you do not repent, you will all perish in the same way. »
He tells this parable. "A man had planted a fig tree in his vineyard. He came to look for fruit on this fig tree and found none.
He said to the husbandman, "I have been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree for three years and I have not found any. Cut it down!
He replied, "Lord, leave him alone again this year, until I dig around him and fertilize him.
If it bears fruit, so much the better; if not, after that, you can cut it off. »
He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
And behold, there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten herself in any way.
Jesus, having seen her, called to her and said to her, "Woman, you are freed from your infirmity."
He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up and glorified God.
The ruler of the synagogue, indignant that Jesus had done healings on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, "There are six days on which one must work. Come on those days to be healed, and not on the Sabbath! » .
The Lord answered him, "Hypocrites! Does not each of you free his ox or donkey from the stable on the Sabbath and lead it to the water?
Is not this woman, daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, to be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath? » .
As he said these things, all his opponents were disappointed, and the whole crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things he had done.
He said, "What does the Kingdom of God look like? To what shall I compare it?
It is like a mustard seed that a man has taken and put in his garden. It has grown and has become a great tree, and the birds of the air live in its branches. »
He also said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
It is like leaven, which a woman has taken and hidden in three measures of flour, until all is leavened. »
He passed through towns and villages, taught, and went to Jerusalem.
Someone said to him, "Lord, are there few who are saved?" He said to them:
"Strive to enter by the narrow gate; for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able to do so.
When the householder has risen and closed the door, and you have gone outside and knocked at the door, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us," he will answer you, "I do not know you, and I do not know where you come from."
Then you will begin to say, "We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets."
And he will say: "I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity."
There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast out.
They will come from the east, from the west, from the north and from the south, and they will sit in the kingdom of God.
Behold, there are the last who will be the first, and there are the first who will be the last. »
That same day the Pharisees came and said to him, "Come out of here and go away, for Herod wants to kill you."
He said to them, "Go and tell this fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and I do healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I complete my mission.
Nevertheless, I must continue my journey today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, for it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem.
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to her! How often have I wanted to gather your children, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you have refused!
Behold, your house will be left deserted to you. I tell you, you will not see me until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
As he entered the house of one of the chief Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread, they observed him.
And behold, a man suffering from dropsy was in front of him.
Jesus, speaking to the jurists and Pharisees, said, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
But they were silent. He took him, cured him, and let him go.
He answered them, "Which of you, if his son or ox fell into a well, would not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath?"
They could not answer him on these things.
He addressed a parable to the guests, noticing that they chose the best seats, and he said to them:
"When someone invites you to a wedding, do not sit in the best place, for it may be that someone more honorable than you is invited by him,
and let the one who invited you both come and say, "Make room for this person." Then you would start, with shame, to take the lowest place.
But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that the one who invited you will come and say to you, "My friend, go up higher." Then you will be honored in the presence of all those who are at the table with you.
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. »
He also said to the one who had invited him, "When you prepare a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors, for they may also reciprocate and pay you.
But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the crippled, the lame, or the blind;
And you will be blessed, because they do not have the means to reimburse you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. »
When one of those who were at table with him heard these things, he said to him, "Blessed is he who makes a feast in the kingdom of God!"
But he said to him, "A man has made a great supper, and he has invited many people.
At mealtime, he sent his servant to say to the guests, "Come, for everything is ready now.
All of them, as one man, began to apologize. The first said to him, "I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. I apologize for me.
Another said, "I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I must go and try them. I apologize for me.
Another said, "I married a woman, so I can't come.
"And this servant came, and told his master these things. The householder, angry, said to his servant, "Go quickly through the streets and alleys of the city, and bring the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.
"The servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you have commanded, and there is still room.'
The master said to the servant, "Go to the roads and hedges, and force them to come in, so that my house may be filled.
For I tell you that none of these men who have been invited will taste my supper.'
Now a great crowd went with him. He turned to them and said:
"If anyone comes to me and does not disregard his father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.
Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow me, cannot be my disciple.
For which of you, if he wishes to build a tower, does not first sit down to calculate the cost of it, in order to see if he has enough to complete it?
Or, when he has laid the foundation and cannot finish, all who see him begin to laugh at him,
saying, "This man began to build and could not finish."
Or what king, when he goes to meet another king in a war, does not first sit down to see if he is able, with ten thousand men, to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand men?
Or, while the other is still far away, he sends an emissary and asks for peace conditions.
Therefore, the one among you who does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be my disciple.
"Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, what do you season it with?
It is not good for the land or for the dung heap. We throw him out. Let him who has ears to hear, hear. »
Now all publicans and sinners came to him to hear him.
The Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."
He told them this parable:
"Which of you, if he had a hundred sheep and lost one, would not leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness to run after the one that is lost, until he finds it?
When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders rejoicing.
When he returned home, he called his friends and neighbors, saying to them, "Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost!"
I say unto you, likewise, there shall be more joy in heaven for one sinner who repents, than for ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.
"Or what woman, if she had ten drachmas, if she lost one, would not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search diligently until she found it?
When she has found it, she summons her friends and neighbors saying: "Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma I had lost!"
In the same way, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents. »
He said, "A man had two sons.
The youngest said to his father: "Father, give me my share of your property." So he divided his livelihood between them.
A few days after, the younger son collected all these and went to a distant country. There he squandered his possessions by living in debauchery.
When he had spent everything, a great famine came upon that country, and he began to be in need.
He went to attach himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed the pigs.
He wanted to fill his belly with the pods that the pigs ate, but no one gave him any.
When he came to himself, he said, "How many of my father's hirelings have bread in abundance, and I am dying of hunger!
I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.
I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me one of your hirelings. »''
"He got up and went to his father. But, as he was still far away, his father saw him and was moved with compassion; he ran, threw himself on his neck and kissed him.
The son said to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your eyes. I am no longer worthy to be called your son."
"But the father said to his servants, 'Bring the most beautiful robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.
Bring the fattened calf, kill it, let us eat and celebrate;
for this one, my son, was dead and he lives again. He was lost and he is found. And they began to celebrate.
"Now, his eldest son was in the fields. As he approached the house, he heard music and dancing.
He called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.
He said to him, "Your brother has arrived, and your father has killed the fattened calf, for he has received it safe and sound.
But he became angry and would not enter. Then his father went out and begged him.
But he replied to his father, "I have served you for so many years and I have never disobeyed one of your commandments, but you have never given me a goat so that I can celebrate with my friends.
But when your son arrived, he who devoured your life with prostitutes, you killed the fatted calf for him.
He said to him, "My son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
But it was fitting to celebrate and rejoice, for this one, your brother, was dead, and he rose again. He was lost, and he is found. »
He also said to his disciples, "There was a rich man who had a manager. He was reproached that this man was wasting his property.
He called to him and said, "What do I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you can no longer be a manager.
"The manager said to himself, 'What am I going to do, since my lord is taking away the position of manager from me? I don't have the strength to dig deeper. I am ashamed to beg.
I know what I will do, so that, when I am relieved of my duties, I will be received in his house.
Calling each of his master's debtors, he said to the first, "How much do you owe to my master?"
He replied, "A hundred batos of oil." He said to him: "Take your ticket, sit down quickly and write fifty".
He then said to another, "How much do you owe? He replied, "A hundred corns of wheat." He said to him, "Take your note, and write eighty.
"His lord congratulated the dishonest manager because he had acted wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of light.
I say to you, make friends by means of an iniquitous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.
He who is faithful in a few things is also faithful in many. He who is dishonest for a few things is also dishonest for many.
If, then, you have not been faithful in unrighteous riches, who will entrust you with true riches?
If you have not been faithful in what belongs to others, who will give you what belongs to you?
No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate one and love the other, or he will cling to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. »
The Pharisees, who loved money, also heard all these things, and they mocked him.
He said to them, "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
"The law and the prophets went as far as John. From then on, the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone enters it by force.
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than to make a little stroke of the pen fall from the law.
"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. Whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
There was a rich man there, dressed in purple and fine linen, and living every day in luxury.
A beggar, named Lazarus, was led to his door, covered with sores,
and desirous of feeding on the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. And even the dogs came to lick his wounds.
The beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels into the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.
In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being a prey to torments, and he saw Abraham in the distance, and Lazarus in his bosom.
He cried out, "Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in the water and cool my tongue. For I am prey to anguish in this flame.
"But Abraham said, 'My son, remember that you received your good things while you were alive, and Lazarus in the same way received bad things. But now he is comforted and you are in anguish.
In addition to all this, between us and you, a great gap is fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot do so, and no one can pass from there to us."
He said, "I ask you, then, father, to send him to my father's house.
for I have five brothers - that he may bear witness to them and that they too may not go to this place of torment."
"But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.
"He answered, 'No, father Abraham, but if anyone comes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if anyone rises from the dead.'
He said to the disciples, "It is impossible that there should be no opportunities for sinning, but woe to him through whom they come!
It would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and thrown into the sea, rather than to make one of these little ones stumble.
Beware. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.
If he has sinned against you seven times in a day, and seven times he returns, saying, "I repent," you shall forgive him. »
The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."
The Lord said, "If you had faith like a mustard seed, you would say to that sycamore tree, 'Uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea,' and it would obey you.
But who among you, having a servant who ploughs or herds sheep, will say to him, when he returns from the field, "Come and sit down at the table at once"?
Will he not rather say to him: "Prepare my meal, dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink. Then you will eat and drink"?
Does he thank this servant because he did as he was commanded? I don't think so.
In the same way, you also, when you have done all that has been commanded you, say, "We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty. »
As he was on his way to Jerusalem, he passed through the borders of Samaria and Galilee.
As he entered a village, ten leper men, who were standing aside, came to meet him.
They lifted up their voices and said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
When he saw them, he said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." As they went, they were cleansed.
One of them, seeing that he was healed, retraced his steps, glorifying God with a loud voice.
He fell on his face at the feet of Jesus and gave thanks to him; he was a Samaritan.
Jesus answered, "Have not the ten been cleansed? But where are the other nine?
Have not others been found who have returned to give glory to God, except this stranger? »
Then he said to him, "Get up and go away. Your faith has healed you. »
When the Pharisees asked him when the kingdom of God would come, he replied, "The kingdom of God does not come as an observer;
neither will we say, "Look here!" or "Look there!" for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you. »
He said to the disciples, "The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you will not see it.
You will be told: "Look here!" or "Look there!" Do not walk away or follow them,
for as lightning, when it starts from one part of heaven, shines to another part of heaven, so it will be with the Son of Man in his day.
But first he must suffer a lot and be rejected by this generation.
As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
They ate, they drank, they married, and they were betrothed until the day Noah got into the boat, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
It was the same in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
but on the day that Lot came out of Sodom, there fell from heaven a rain of fire and brimstone, which destroyed them all.
So it will be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
On that day, whoever is on the roof and has his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away. In the same way, let not whoever is in the field turn back.
Remember Lot's wife!
He who seeks to save his life loses it, but he who loses his life preserves it.
I tell you, on that night, there will be two people in the same bed. One will be taken and the other left.
There will be two people grinding grain together. One will be taken and the other left."
And they, answering, asked him, "Where, Lord?" He said to them, "Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered."
He also told them, in a parable, that they should always pray and not be discouraged,
saying, "There was a judge in a certain city who did not fear God and did not respect men.
There was a widow in that city who often came to him and said, "Defend me against my adversary."
He would not for some time; but then he said to himself, 'Although I do not fear God and do not respect man,
however, because this widow is bothering me, I will defend her, or else she will tire me out by her continual coming.'
The Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
Will not God take vengeance on his elect who cry out to him day and night, and yet show patience with them?
I tell you that he will soon avenge them. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth? »
He also told this parable to some who were convinced of their own righteousness and despised all others:
Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a publican.
The Pharisee stood and prayed alone thus: God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, nor even like this publican.
I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I receive.'
But the publican, who stood aside, did not even raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, "God, have mercy on me, who am a sinner.
I tell you, this one went down to his house justified rather than the other; for whoever exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted. »
They also brought their babies to him, so that he could touch them. But the disciples, seeing this, rebuked them.
Jesus called them and said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like them.
Verily, I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, will not enter it. »
A certain chief asked him, "Good master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
Jesus asked him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one: God.
You know the commandments: "Do not commit adultery", "Do not commit murder", "Do not steal", "Do not bear false witness", "Honor your father and mother".
He replied, "I have observed all these things since my youth."
When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and distribute it to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me. »
But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
Jesus, seeing that he was very sad, said, "How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!
For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God. »
Those who heard him said, "Then who can be saved?"
But he said, "What is impossible to men is possible to God."
Peter said, "Look, we have left everything and followed you."
He said to them, "Verily, I say to you, there is no one who has left his house, or his wife, or his brothers, or his parents, or his children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
who does not receive eternal life many times in this time and in the world to come. »
He took the twelve aside and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all that is written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
For he will be handed over to the Gentiles, he will be mocked, he will be insulted, he will be spat on.
He will be scourged and put to death. On the third day, he will rise again. »
They didn't understand anything about these things. This word was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things that were said.
As he approached Jericho, a blind man sat by the side of the road begging.
Hearing a crowd passing by, he asked what it meant.
He was told that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
He cried out, "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!"
Those who led the way rebuked him to be silent; but he cried out even louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
When Jesus stopped, he ordered him to be brought to Himself. Approaching, he asked him:
"What do you want me to do?" He said, "Lord, that I may see again."
Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you. »
Immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw him, praised God.
He entered and passed through Jericho.
There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a great tax collector, and he was rich.
He sought to see who Jesus was, but he could not because of the crowd, for he was of small stature.
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, for he was going to pass that way.
When Jesus arrived at this place, he looked up and saw him, and he said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry down, for today I must stay with you."
He hastened, alighted, and received him with joy.
When they saw him, they all murmured, saying, "He has come in to lodge with a man who is a sinner."
Zacchaeus, standing, said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor. If I have unjustly demanded something from someone, I give him back four times more. »
Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, for he also is the son of Abraham.
For the Son of Man came to seek and save what was lost. »
When they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to be revealed immediately.
So he said, "A certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom and to return.
He called ten of his servants, gave them ten pieces of mina, and said to them, "Mind your own business until I come.
But his fellow citizens hated him and sent an emissary after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to rule over us.'
"When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he commanded that these servants, to whom he had given the money, should be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.
The first one came before him and said, "Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.
He said to him, "It is good, good servant. Because you have been found faithful with very little, you will have authority over ten cities.
"The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.'
He said to him, "And you will be the ruler of five cities."
Another came, saying, "Lord, here is your mina, which I have kept in a handkerchief,
for I feared you, because you are a demanding man. You gather what you have not laid down, and you reap what you have not sown.
He said to him, "With your own mouth I will judge you, wicked servant! You knew that I am a demanding man, taking what I have not laid down and reaping what I have not sown.
So, why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, so that when I return, I get an interest on it?
He said to those who were standing there, "Take away the mina from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.
They said to him, "Lord, he has ten minas!
For, I say to you, to whoever has anything, more will be given; but from him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.
But bring here those of my enemies who did not want me to reign over them, and kill them before me. »
Having said these things, he set out on his way, going up to Jerusalem.
When he approached Bethsphage and Bethany, on the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
saying, "Go to the other side of the village, where you will find, on entering, a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it in.
If someone asks you, "Why are you untying him?" say to him, "The Lord needs him."
Those who had been sent went away and found things exactly as he had said them.
As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
They answered, "The Lord needs it."
Then they brought him to Jesus. They threw their cloaks over the colt, and made Jesus sit on it.
While he was going, they spread their cloaks on the road.
As he approached the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God aloud for all the wonders they had seen.
saying, "Blessed be the King who comes in the name of the Lord!" Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest! »
Some of the Pharisees of the crowd said to him, "Master, rebuke your disciples!"
He answered them, "I tell you, if they were silent, the stones would cry out."
When he came near, he saw the city and wept over it,
saying, "If you had known today the things that belong to your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
For the days will come upon you when your enemies will set up a barricade against you, surround you, and enclose you on all sides,
and will throw you to the ground, you and your children who are in you. They will not leave one stone in you on top of the other, because you have not known the moment of your punishment. »
He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there,
saying to them, "It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a 'den of thieves.'"
He taught every day in the temple, but the chief priests, the scribes, and the chief men of the people sought to destroy him.
They could not find what they could do, for all the people were attached to his every word.
One of these days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, the priests and scribes came to him with the elders.
They asked him, "Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who gives you this authority? »
He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me:
Was John's baptism from heaven, or from men? »
They reasoned thus: "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'"
But if we say, "Men," all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet. »
They replied that they did not know where it came from.
Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
He began to tell this parable to the people: A man planted a vineyard, rented it to farmers, and went on a long stay in another country.
At the proper time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vine. But the peasants beat him and sent him away empty.
He sent another servant, who was also beaten and ill-treated, and who was sent away empty.
He sent a third again; they wounded him also and threw him out.
The owner of the vineyard said, "What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Maybe when they see him, they will respect him.
"But when the peasants saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'He is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may come back to us.
Then they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What will the master of the vineyard do to them?
He will come and destroy these peasants, and he will give the vineyard to others. When they heard this, they said, "May it never be! »
But he looked at them and said, "Then what is the meaning of what is written, 'The stone which the builders rejected was made the chief cornerstone?'
All who fall on this stone will be broken in pieces, but it will reduce to dust the one on whom it falls. »
The chief priests and the scribes were trying to lay their hands on him at that very hour, but they feared the people, for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them.
They watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be righteous, in order to trap him in one of his words, to deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.
They asked him this question: "Master, we know that you say and teach what is right, that you have no bias for anyone, and that you truly teach the way of God.
Are we allowed to pay taxes to Caesar or not? »
But, realizing their cunning, he said to them: "Why do you try me?
Show me a denarius. To whom does the image and the inscription it bears belong? They answered, "Caesar's." »
He said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
They did not succeed in trapping him in his words before the people. They were surprised by his answer and were silent.
Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny the existence of the resurrection.
They asked him: "Master, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies having a wife and is childless, his brother should take the wife and raise children for his brother.
So there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.
The second took her as his wife, and he died childless.
The third took it, and the other seven left no children and died.
After this, the woman also died.
Wherefore, at the resurrection, shall she be the wife of her? For the seven had her for their wife. »
Jesus said to them, "The children of this world marry and are given in marriage.
But those who are deemed worthy to reach this world and the resurrection of the dead do not marry or are given in marriage.
For they can no longer die, since they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.
But that the dead rise, Moses himself showed at the bush, when he called the Lord "God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob."
Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him. »
Some of the scribes replied, "Master, you speak well."
They did not dare to ask him any further questions.
He said to them, "Why is it said that Christ is the son of David?
David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
"David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
In the presence of all the people, he said to his disciples:
"Beware of those scribes who love to walk about in long robes, and who love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places in the festivals;
who devour the houses of widows, and who, for a pretext, make long prayers. These will receive a greater condemnation. »
He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.
He saw a poor widow throwing two small pieces of brass.
He said, "Verily I say to you, this poor widow has put more than all of them,
for all these have given gifts to God of their superfluity, but she, from her poverty, has put all she had to live. »
As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, he said:
"As for these things which you see, the days will come when there will not be one stone left here upon another that is not overturned."
They asked him, "Master, when will these things happen? What is the sign that these things are going to happen? »
He said, "Take heed that you do not let yourselves be led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, 'It is I,' and 'The time is at hand.' So don't follow them.
When you hear of wars and troubles, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately. »
Then he said to them, "A nation will rise up against a nation, and a kingdom against a kingdom.
There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.
But before all this, they will lay hands on you, persecute you, deliver you up to synagogues and prisons, bring you before kings and governors, for my name's sake.
The result will be a testimony for you.
So get it into your head not to think in advance about how to respond,
for I will give you a mouth and wisdom that all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict.
You will be delivered even by your parents, brothers, relatives and friends. They will have some of you put to death.
You will be hated by all men for my name's sake.
And not a hair of your head will perish.
"It is by your endurance that you will earn your living.
"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, know that its desolation is at hand.
So let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of it go. Let those who are in the countryside not enter it.
For these are days of vengeance, that all that is written may be fulfilled.
Woe to pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and great anger for this people.
They will fall under the edge of the sword, and they will be taken captive to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trodden under foot by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on earth, the anguish of the nations, in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves;
men will be seized with fear and expectation of the things that are going to happen to the world, for the powers of heaven will be shaken.
Then they will see the Son of Man coming on a cloud with power and great glory.
But when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption is near. »
He told them a parable. "Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
When they are already budding, you see it and you know for yourself that summer is already near.
In the same way, you too, when you see these things happening, you know that the Kingdom of God is at hand.
Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all is accomplished.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
"Take heed, then, that your hearts do not weigh down under the weight of the pleasures of the feast, of the drunkenness and cares of the present life, and that this day does not come upon you unexpectedly.
For he will come as a snare for all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
Watch therefore continually, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to present yourselves before the Son of man. »
Every day Jesus taught in the temple, and every evening he went out and spent the night on the mountain called Mount Olivet.
All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to listen to him.
Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
The chief priests and scribes were looking for how they could put him to death, for they feared the people.
Satan entered into Judas, also called Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve.
He went away, and conversed with the chief priests and military commanders as to how he could deliver him up to them.
They were happy, and agreed to give him money.
He consented to this, and sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them in the absence of the crowd.
The day of unleavened bread arrived, when the Passover was to be sacrificed.
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it."
They said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare?"
He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jug of water will come to meet you. Follow him into the house where he will enter.
Say to the master of the house, "The master says to you, 'Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'
He will show you a large furnished upper room. Make your preparations there. »
They went out, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared for the Passover.
When the hour came, he sat down with the twelve apostles.
He said to them, "I have long desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,
for, I say to you, I will not eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. »
He received a cup, and, after giving thanks, he said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves,
for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine at all, until the kingdom of God is accomplished. »
He took bread, and, after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in memory of me. »
In the same way, after the meal, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
The Son of Man is indeed departing, as he has been decided, but woe to the man by whom he is betrayed! »
They began to wonder among themselves which of them was the one who would do this thing.
A dispute also arose between them, as to which of them was considered the greatest.
He said to them, "The kings of the nations rule over them, and those who have authority over them are called 'benefactors.'
But it is not the same for you. On the contrary, let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who governs, like the one who serves.
For who is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? Isn't it the one who sits at the table? But I am in your midst as one who serves.
"But you are the ones who have persevered with me in my trials.
I give you a kingdom, as my Father has conferred on me,
so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. You will sit on thrones, and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel. »
The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all, that he may sift you like wheat,
but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. You, when you have turned around, strengthen your brothers. »
He said to him: "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!"
He said, "I tell you, Peter, the will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me."
He said to them, "When I sent you without purse, without bag, and without sandals, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing."
Then he said to them, "Now, if anyone has a purse, let him take it, and a sack. If anyone has none, let him sell his cloak and buy a sword.
For I say to you, it is still necessary that what is written in me should be fulfilled, "He was numbered among the transgressors." For what concerns me is fulfilled. »
They said, "Lord, here are two swords." He told them, "Enough is enough."
He went out and went, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.
When he arrived at that place, he said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."
He withdrew from them about a stone's throw away, and, having knelt down, he prayed,
saying, "Father, if you will, remove this cup from me. However, let it not be my will that is done, but yours. »
An angel from heaven appeared to him, and strengthened him.
Being in agony, he prayed more ardently. His sweat became like large drops of blood falling on the ground.
Having risen after praying, he came to the disciples and found them asleep because of sadness,
and he said to them, "Why do you sleep? Stand up and pray that you do not enter into temptation. »
While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared. He who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was at their head. He approached Jesus to kiss him.
But Jesus said to him, "Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray the Son of man?"
Those who were around him, seeing what was about to happen, said to him, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
A number of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
But Jesus answered, "Let me at least do this." He touched his ear and healed him.
Jesus said to the chief priests, the temple rulers, and the elders, who had come against him, "You went out as against a robber, with swords and staves?
When I was with you every day in the temple, you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness. »
They seized him, took him away, and conducted him to the house of the high priest. But Pierre followed at a distance.
When they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.
A servant saw him as he was sitting in the light, and, looking at him attentively, she said, "This man also was with him."
He denied Jesus, saying, "Woman, I do not know Him."
A little later, someone else saw him and said, "You too are one of them!" But Peter answered, "I am not a man."
After about an hour had passed, another confidently said, "Verily, this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean."
But Peter said, "Boy, I don't know what you're talking about!" Immediately, while he was still speaking, a crowed.
The Lord turned around and looked at Peter. Peter then remembered the word of the Lord, who had said to him, "Before the crows, you shall deny me three times."
He went out, and wept bitterly.
The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.
Having blindfolded him, they struck him in the face and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is it that struck you? »
They said many other things against him, insulting him.
As soon as the day came, the assembly of the elders of the people assembled, the chief priests and the scribes, and they took him into their council, saying:
"If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell you, you will not believe,
and if I ask you, you will not answer me and let me go.
From now on, the Son of Man will sit at the right hand of the power of God. »
They all said, "Are you the Son of God?" He said to them, "You say so, because I am."
They said, "Why should we need another testimony? For we ourselves have heard from his own lips! »
The whole company got up and brought him before Pilate.
They began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man who perverts the nation, who forbids Caesar to pay taxes, and who says that he himself is Christ, a king."
Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" He replied, "That's what you say."
Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no reason to accuse this man."
But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching in all Judea, from Galilee to hither."
But Pilate, having heard of Galilee, asked if this man was a Galilean.
When he heard that he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
When Herod saw Jesus, he had great joy, for he had long desired to see him, having heard many things said about him. He hoped to see some miracle accomplished by him.
He questioned him with many words, but he did not answer.
The chief priests and the scribes, standing, accused him vehemently.
Herod and his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. After they had clothed him in luxurious garments, they sent him back to Pilate.
On that day Herod and Pilate became friends, for they had previously been enemies of each other.
Pilate summoned the chief priests, the magistrates, and the people,
and said to them, "You have brought this man to me as a man who perverts the people; Now, after examining it before you, I have found no reason to accuse this man about the things of which you accuse him.
Neither did Herod, for I sent you to him, and behold, he did nothing worthy of death.
So I will chastise him and release him. »
However, he was to release a prisoner to them on the occasion of the feast.
But they all cried out together, "Let go of this man! Release us Barabbas,
who had been thrown into prison for a revolt in the city and for murder. »
Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,
but they cried out, "Crucified! Crucify him! »
He said to them for the third time: "Why? What harm has this man done? I have not found in him any capital crime. So I will chastise him and release him. »
But they insisted aloud, demanding that he be crucified. Their voices and those of the chief priests prevailed.
Pilate decreed that whatever they asked for should be done.
He released the one who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they demanded, but he delivered Jesus to their will.
After taking him away, they seized a certain Simon of Cyrene who had come from the country and put the cross on him to carry it after Jesus.
A great crowd of the people followed him, including women who also wept and lamented him.
But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
For the days are coming when they will say: Blessed are the barren, the wombs that have not given birth, the breasts that have not suckled!
Then they will begin to say to the mountains, "Fall upon us," and to the hills, "Cover us."
For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry tree?
There were also others, two malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
When they arrived at the place called "Skull", they crucified him there with the evildoers, one on the right and the other on the left.
Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." They divided his clothes by drawing lots.
The people were there, watching. The chiefs who were with them also mocked him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one! »
The soldiers also mocked him, approaching him and offering him vinegar,
and saying, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!"
An inscription was also placed above him in Greek, Latin and Hebrew letters: "HE IS THE KING OF THE JEWS".
One of the criminals who had been hanged insulted him, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us."
But the other, speaking up, rebuked him and said, "You do not even fear God, since you are under the same condemnation?
For we are just, for we receive the reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong. »
He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
Jesus said to him, "Verily I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise."
It was about the sixth hour, and darkness spread over the whole country until the ninth hour.
The sun grew darker, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
Jesus, uttering a loud cry, said, "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit." Having said this, he breathed his last.
The centurion, seeing what had happened, glorified God, saying, "Certainly, he was a righteous man."
The whole crowd that had gathered to see this, seeing what had happened, returned home beating their breasts.
All the people of his acquaintance and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance, observing these things.
Behold, there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Sanhedrin, a good and righteous man
(he had not consented to their counsels and actions), a native of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the kingdom of God.
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
He lowered it, wrapped it in a shroud, and laid it in a tomb hewn in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was approaching.
The women of Galilee who had come with him followed, and saw the tomb and the manner in which his body had been laid down.
They returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested, according to the commandment.
On the first day of the week, at dawn, they went to the tomb with other people, bringing the spices they had prepared.
They found the stone rolled up in front of the tomb.
They went in, and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
As they were very perplexed on this subject, behold, two men stood near them, dressed in dazzling garments.
Seized with terror, they prostrated themselves with their faces to the ground. Men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
He is not here, but he is risen. Remember what he said to you, when he was still in Galilee,
namely, that the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of sinful men, to be crucified, and to rise again on the third day. »
They remembered his words,
returned from the tomb, and related all these things to the eleven and to all the others.
They were Mary Magdalene, Joanna and Mary, mother of James. The other women who were with them related these things to the apostles.
These words seemed to them foolish, and they did not believe them.
But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down and looked in; he saw the strips of linen spread out by themselves, and he went home, wondering what had happened.
Behold, on the same day, two of them went to a village called Emmaus, situated sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
They talked among themselves about all these things that had happened.
As they were discussing and questioning each other, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them.
But their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.
He said to them, "What are you talking about as you walk, and are you sad?"
One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know what has happened there these days?"
He said to them, "What things?" They said to him, "Concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and before all the people,
and how the chief priests and our leaders delivered him up to be condemned to death and crucified him.
But we hoped that he would be the one who would buy Israel. Yes, and on top of all that, it's now been the third day since these things happened.
Moreover, some of the women of our company astonished us, having arrived early at the tomb;
and not having found his body, they came to say that they too had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
Some of us went to the tomb and found him as the women had said, but they did not see him. »
He said to them, "Foolish people, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have foretold!
Must not Christ have suffered these things and entered into his glory? »
Starting from Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures what concerned him.
They approached the village where they were going, and he pretended to go further.
They urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for evening has just fallen, and the day is almost over." He went in to stay with them.
After sitting down to table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. He broke it and gave it to them.
Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; then he disappeared from their sight.
They said to one another, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us?"
They got up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled, and those who were with them,
saying, "The Lord is truly risen, and has appeared to Simon."
They related what had happened on the way, and how they had recognized him by the breaking of the bread.
As they said this, Jesus himself stood in their midst and said to them, "Peace be with you."
But they were terrified and filled with fear, and they supposed that they had seen a spirit.
He said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?
See my hands and my feet, that it is really me. Touch me and see, for a spirit has no flesh and bones, as you see that I have. »
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.
As they did not yet believe in joy and were astonished, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"
They gave him a piece of grilled fish and honeycomb.
He took them, and ate in their presence.
He said to them, "This is what I told you when I was still with you, that all that is written about me in the law of Moses, in the prophets, and in the psalms must be fulfilled."
Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.
He said to them, "Thus it is written, and so it was necessary that Christ should suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning with Jerusalem.
You are witnesses of these things.
Behold, I am sending upon you the promise of my Father. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high. »
He led them as far as Bethany, and then raising his hands he blessed them.
While he was blessing them, he withdrew from them and was taken up to heaven.
They bowed down to him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
and they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by her. Without it, nothing has been done of what has been done.
In him was life, and life was the light of men.
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not conquered it.
There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.
He came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, that all might believe through him.
He was not the light, but he was sent to bear witness to the light.
The true light, which enlightens everyone, came into the world.
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world did not recognize him.
He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.
But to all who received him, he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,
who are born, not of the blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
The Word became flesh and lived among us. We have seen his glory, a glory like that of the only begotten Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
John testified of him. He cried out, "He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'"
From his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace.
For the law was given by Moses. Grace and truth have been realized by Jesus Christ.
At no time has anyone seen God. The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared it.
This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
He declared, and did not deny, but he declared, "I am not the Christ."
They asked him, "Who? Are you Elijah? He said, "I'm not." "You are the prophet?" He replied, "No." »
So they said to him, "Who are you? Give us an answer to report to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself? »
He says, "I am the voice of him crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."
Those who had been sent were Pharisees.
They asked him, "Why do you baptize, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"
John answered them, "I baptize in water, but there is someone among you whom you do not know.
It is he who comes after me, who is preferred to me, and whose strap I am not worthy to untie. »
These things were happening at Bethany, on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
The next day he saw Jesus coming to him, and he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
It is he of whom I have said: "After me comes a man who is preferred to me, for he was before me.
I did not know him, but that is why I came to baptize in water, that he might be revealed to Israel. »
John testified: "I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and he remained upon him.
I did not recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize in water said to me: "The one on whom you will see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.
I have seen and testified that he is the Son of God. »
The next day, John was still standing with two of his disciples,
and, looking at Jesus who was walking, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God."
The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
Jesus turned round, saw them following him, and said to them, "What are you looking for?" They said to him, "Rabbi," "Where do you live?"
He said to them, "Come and see." They came and saw where he was, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
One of those who had heard John and followed him was Andrew, brother of Simon Peter.
He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah!" (that is, according to the interpretation, Christ).
He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon, son of Jonah. You will be called Cephas" (which is, by interpretation, Peter).
The next day, determined to go to Galilee, he found Philip. Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
Philip, having found Nathanael, said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets spoke: Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph."
Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."
Jesus, seeing Nathanael approaching him, said of him, "This is truly an Israelite in whom there is no deceit!"
Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
Nathanael replied, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel! »
Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You'll see bigger things than these! »
He said to him, "Most assuredly, I say to you all, you will see heaven opened from now on, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man."
On the third day there was a wedding at Cana of Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there.
Jesus was also invited, with his disciples, to the wedding.
When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no wine."
Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does this have to do with you and me? My time has not yet come. »
His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he tells you, do it."
Now, he| there were six stone vessels of water, placed according to the method of purification of the Jews, and each containing two or three meters.
Jesus said to them, "Fill the vessels with water." So they filled them to the brim.
He said to them, "Now draw a little water, and carry it to the master of the festival." So they took it.
When the master of the meal had tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the meal called the bridegroom
and said to him, "Let each one serve the good wine first, and then, when the guests have drunk, the less good. You, you have kept the good wine until now! »
This beginning of his miracles Jesus accomplished at Cana of Galilee, and he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they stayed there a few days.
The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money-changers seated.
He made a whip of ropes and drove them all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; he threw the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables.
To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father's house a marketplace! »
His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will devour me."
So the Jews answered him, "What sign do you show us, since you do these things?"
Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
So the Jews said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days? »
But he spoke of the temple of his body.
So when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.
Now, when he was in Jerusalem, at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing the miracles he performed.
But Jesus did not confide in them, because he knew everyone,
and that he had no need of anyone to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.
There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, chief of the Jews.
He came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher from God; for no one can do these signs that you make, unless God is with him. »
Jesus answered him, "Verily, I say to you, unless anyone is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."
Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother's womb a second time and be born? »
Jesus answered, "Truly I say to you, unless a man is born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
That which is born of the flesh is flesh. He who is born of the Spirit is spirit.
Do not be surprised that I said to you, "You must be born again."
The wind blows where it wills, and you hear its sound; but you do not know whence he comes or whither he goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit. »
Nicodemus replied, "How can these things be?"
Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and do you not understand these things?
Verily I say to you, we speak what we know, and we bear witness of what we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony.
If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
No one has ascended into heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.
As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
so that whoever believes in him may not perish, but have eternal life.
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.
Whoever believes in him is not judged. He who does not believe is already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.
This is the judgment: light came into the world, and men preferred darkness to light, because their works were evil.
For whoever does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works be revealed.
But he who practices the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, and that they may be done in God. »
After these things, Jesus came with his disciples to the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized.
John also baptized at Enon, near Salim, because there was a lot of water there. They came and were baptized;
for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
John's disciples then had a dispute with some Jews about the purification.
They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the one who was with you beyond the Jordan, and to whom you have borne witness, behold, he baptizes, and all the world come to him."
John answered, "A man cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven."
You yourselves bear witness that I said, "I am not the Christ," but "I was sent before him."
He who has the bride is the husband; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and listens to him, rejoices greatly because of the voice of the bridegroom. That is why my joy is complete.
It has to increase, but I have to decrease.
"He who comes from above is above all. He who comes from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
What he has seen and heard he testifies, and no one receives his testimony.
The one who received his testimony has stamped with his seal that God is true.
For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.
The Father loves the Son, and he has placed all things in his hands.
He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him. »
The Lord, knowing that the Pharisees had learned that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples),
left Judea and went to Galilee.
He had to pass through Samaria.
So he came to a city in Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
Jacob's well was there. Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to him, "Give me something to drink."
For his disciples had gone to the city to buy provisions.
So the Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, who are a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?" (For the Jews have nothing to do with the Samaritans).
Jesus answered him, "If you knew what the gift of God is, and who it is that says to you, 'Give me something to drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw from, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get this living water?
Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his children and his cattle? »
Jesus answered him, "Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,
but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life. »
The woman said to him, "Lord, give me this water, so that I may not thirst and come hither to draw."
Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come hither."
The woman replied, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You have said, 'I have no husband.'
for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. You have said it in truth. »
The woman said to him, "Sir, I see that you are a prophet.
Our fathers prostrated themselves on this mountain, and you Jews say that the place to prostrate oneself is in Jerusalem. »
Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will not worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.
You worship what you don't know. We worship what we know, for salvation comes from the Jews.
But the hour is coming, and it is now, when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeks such worshippers.
God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth. »
The woman said to him, "I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called Christ. When he comes, he will announce all things to us. »
Jesus said to him, "It is I who speak to you."
Immediately his disciples arrived. They were astonished that he was talking to a woman; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?" or "Why are you talking to her?"
So the woman left her water pot, went into the city and said to the people:
"Come and see a man who told me everything I did. Is this Christ? »
They went out of the city, and approached him.
Meanwhile, the disciples pressed him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
But he said to them, "I have a meal to eat that you don't know."
So the disciples said to one another, "Has anyone brought him anything to eat?"
Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to do his work.
Don't you say, "There are still four months before the harvest? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields: they are already white for the harvest.
The one who reaps receives a reward and reaps fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together.
For this saying is true: "One sows, the other reaps".
I have sent you to reap what you have not worked. Others have worked, and you have participated in their work. »
Many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him, because of the word of the woman, who testified, "He has told me all that I have done." »
So the Samaritans came to him and begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.
Many others believed because of his word.
They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of what you have said, but because we have heard it ourselves, and we know that it is truly Christ, the Savior of the world."
After these two days, he left thence and went to Galilee.
For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans received him, after seeing all that he was doing in Jerusalem during the festival, for they also went to the festival.
So Jesus returned to Cana of Galilee, where he changed water into wine. There was a gentleman at Capernaum whose son was ill.
When he heard that Jesus had gone from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
Jesus then said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe in any way."
The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
Jesus said to him, "Go away. Your son is alive. The man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went away.
As he was descending, his servants came to meet him and said, "Your child lives!"
So he inquired of them what time he began to get better. So they said to him, "Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him."
The father knew, then, that it was at that hour that Jesus had said to him, "Your son lives." He believed, as well as all his house.
Here again is the second sign that Jesus made, after he had passed from Judea into Galilee.
After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
Now there is in Jerusalem, near the sheep's gate, a pool called in Hebrew "Bethesda," and with five porticoes.
A great crowd of the sick, the blind, the lame or the paralytic were lying there, waiting for the water to start moving.
There was a man there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.
Jesus, when he saw him lying there, and knowing that he had been sick for a long time, asked him, "Do you want to be healed?"
The sick man replied, "Lord, I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is agitated, but while I am coming, another comes down before me."
Jesus said to him, "Get up, take up your mat, and walk."
Immediately, the man was healed, he took up his carpet again and walked. Now, that day was a Sabbath.
So the Jews said to the one who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath. It is not permissible for you to carry the carpet. »
He replied, "The One who healed me said to me, 'Take up your carpet and walk.'"
Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take your carpet and walk?'"
But the one who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.
After this, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, "Behold, you are healed. Sin no more, so that nothing worse may happen to you. »
The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.
Therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to put him to death, because he did these things on the Sabbath.
But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, and I am also working."
Therefore the Jews sought all the more to put him to death, because he not only violated the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, thus making himself equal to God.
Jesus answered them, "Truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, except what he sees the Father doing. For all that the Son does, so does the Son.
For the Father has affection for the Son, and he shows him all that he himself does. He will show him works greater than these, so that you may be astonished.
For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whomever he wills.
For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,
so that all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
Verily I say to you, he who heareth my word and believes in him who sent me hath eternal life, and he does not come to judgment, but has passed from death to life.
Verily I say to you, the hour is coming, and it has already come, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who have heard it shall live.
For as the Father has life in himself, so he gave the Son to have life also in himself.
He also gave him the power to judge, because he is the son of man.
Do not be surprised at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
and those who have done good for the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil for the resurrection of judgment, will come forth.
I can't do anything on my own. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.
"If I testify of myself, my testimony is not valid.
It is another who testifies to me. I know that the testimony he gives of me is true.
You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.
But the testimony I receive does not come from a man. However, I say these things so that you may be saved.
He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were pleased to rejoice for a time in his light.
But the testimony I give is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to do, the very works which I do, bear witness to me, that the Father has sent me.
The Father himself, who sent me, has borne witness of me. You have never heard his voice, nor seen his face.
You do not have his word living in you, because you do not believe in him whom he has sent.
You search the Scriptures, because you think you have eternal life in them; they are the ones who bear witness to me.
But you do not want to come to me, to have life.
I receive no glory from men.
But I know you, and I know that you do not have the love of God in you.
I have come in the name of my Father, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
How can you believe, you who receive the glory of one another, and you who do not seek the glory that comes from the one God?
"Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, in whom you have placed your hope.
For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.
But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words? »
After this, Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Galilee.
A great crowd followed him, because they saw the miracles he performed on the sick.
Jesus went up to the mountain, where he sat down with his disciples.
Now, the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
Jesus, looking up and seeing that a great crowd was coming to him, said to Philip, "Where shall we buy loaves of bread that they may eat?"
He said this to test it, for he himself knew what he would do.
Philip replied, "Two hundred denarii of bread is not enough for them, so that each one may receive a little."
One of his disciples, Andrew, brother of Simon Peter, said to him:
"There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what is it, among many others?"
Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." Now, there was a lot of grass in this place. So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
Jesus took the loaves; and after giving thanks, he distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were seated; they also took fish, as much as they wanted.
When they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the pieces that are left, so that nothing may be lost." »
So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves that were left of those who had eaten.
When the people saw the sign that Jesus was making, they said, "It is truly the prophet who is coming into the world." »
Jesus, knowing that they were going to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again alone to the mountain.
When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea.
They got into the boat, and crossed the sea to Capernaum. It was already night, and Jesus had not come to them.
The sea was agitated by a strong wind that was blowing.
After rowing about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat; and they were afraid.
But he said to them, "It is I; Don't be afraid. »
They therefore wished to receive him in the boat. Immediately the boat was near the land where they were going.
The next day, the crowd on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there than the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus had not gone into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone alone.
Meanwhile, boats coming from Tiberias approached the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
The crowd, seeing that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, got into the boats themselves and came to Capernaum, looking for Jesus.
When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly I say to you, you seek me, not because you have seen miracles, but because you have eaten bread and have been filled."
Do not seek the food that perishes, but that which endures to eternal life, and which the Son of Man will give you. For God the Father has sealed it. »
So they said to him, "What must we do to do the works of God?"
Jesus answered them, "The work of God is that you believe in Him whom He has sent."
So they said to him, "What are you doing as a sign, that we may see you and believe you? What work do you do?
Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness. As it is written, "He gave them bread from heaven to eat."
So Jesus said to them, "Truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. »
So they said to him, "Lord, give us this bread always."
Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes in me will never thirst.
But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.
All those whom the Father gives me will come to me. And I will not cast out anyone who comes to me.
For I have come down from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
Now it is the will of my Father who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but that I should raise him up at the last day.
This is the will of him who sent me: that whoever sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day. »
So the Jews murmured about him, because he had said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then can he say, "I have come down from heaven?"
Jesus answered them, "Do not murmur among yourselves.
No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.
It is written in the prophets: "All will be instructed by God. Therefore all who hear of the Father and have learned, come to me.
It is not that anyone has seen the Father, but the one who comes from God. He has seen the Father.
Verily, I say to you, whoever believes in me has eternal life.
I am the bread of life.
Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness and died.
This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that whoever eats of it and does not die.
I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh. »
So the Jews were arguing among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
So Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves.
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.
He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him.
As the Father who is alive has sent me, and I live through the Father, so he who feeds on me will also live through me.
This is the bread that came down from heaven, and not as our fathers ate manna and died. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. »
He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
Therefore many of his disciples, after hearing this, said, "This word is difficult to hear. Who can listen to him? »
But Jesus, knowing to himself that his disciples were murmuring about it, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?
What if you saw the Son of Man ascend to where He was before?
It is the spirit that gives life. Flesh is useless. The words I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.
But there are some among you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who were those who did not believe, and who was the one who would betray him.
He said, "Therefore I have told you that no one can come to me except it is given to him by my Father."
At this, many of his disciples returned and walked no more with him.
Jesus then said to the twelve, "You also do not want to go away, do you?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.
We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God. »
Jesus answered them, "Have I not chosen you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
Now he was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who was going to betray him, being one of the twelve.
After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, because he did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews were trying to put him to death.
Now, the feast of the Jews, the feast of the Booths, was at hand.
So his brothers said to him, "Go away from here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may also see the works you do."
For no one does anything in secret, while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world. »
Because even his brothers did not believe in him.
So Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it that its works are evil.
You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled. »
After he had told them these things, he remained in Galilee.
But as his brothers had gone up to the feast, he also went up to it, not publicly, but so to speak in secret.
So the Jews looked for him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?"
There was much murmuring among the crowd about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "No, but he leads the crowd astray."
But no one spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
But, as the feast was already in the middle, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
So the Jews were astonished, saying, "How does this man know letters, without ever having been instructed?"
So Jesus answered them, "My doctrine is not mine, but of him who sent me.
If anyone wants to do his will, he will know the doctrine, whether it comes from God or whether I speak of myself.
He who speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and there is no injustice in him.
Did not Moses give you the law, and none of you keep it? Why do you seek to kill me? »
The crowd replied, "You have a demon! Who is trying to kill you? »
Jesus answered them, "I have done one work, and you are all astonished because of it.
Moses gave you circumcision (not that it came from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath day you circumcise a boy.
If a boy is circumcised on the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses may not be violated, are you angry with me because I made a man completely sane on the Sabbath?
Do not judge according to appearances, but judge according to justice. »
Therefore some of those in Jerusalem said, "Is this not the one they are trying to put to death?"
Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Could it be that the leaders know that this is really Christ?
However, we know where this man comes from, but when Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from. »
So Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You know me, and you know where I come from. I did not come of my own accord, but he who sent me is true, he whom you do not know.
I know him, because I am of him, and he sent me. »
So they tried to take him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.
But many among the crowd believed in him. They said, "When Christ comes, he will not make more signs than this man has made, will he?"
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent agents to arrest him.
Then Jesus said, "I will stay with you a little longer, and then I will go to him who sent me.
You will look for me and you will not find me. You can't come where I am. »
So the Jews said among themselves, "Where will this man go, that we may not find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me, and you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'? » .
Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from his bosom. »
But he said this about the Spirit that those who believed in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
Many of the crowd, when they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophet." »
Others said, "It is Christ." But some said, "What, does Christ come from Galilee?
Did not Scripture say that Christ comes from the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? »
So there was a division in the crowd because of him.
Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one got their hands on him.
So the ushers went to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why did you not bring him?"
The officers replied, "No one has ever spoken like this man!"
So the Pharisees answered them, "You too are not lost, are you?
Did any of the leaders, or any of the Pharisees, believe in him?
But this multitude, which does not know the law, is cursed. »
Nicodemus, who was one of them, and who had come to him by night, said to them:
"Does our law judge a man without first hearing him personally and without knowing what he is doing?"
They answered him, "Are you also from Galilee? Seek and see that no prophet has arisen from Galilee. »
Everyone went to their own house,
but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
But early in the morning he entered the temple again, and all the people came to him. He sat down and taught them.
The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery. Having placed it in the middle,
they said to him, "Master, we have found this adulterous woman in the act."
Now, in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What do you say to her? »
They said this to test him, in order to have something to reproach him with. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger.
As they continued to question him, he looked up and said to them, "Whoever among you is without sin should throw the first stone at him."
Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger.
The latter, after hearing this, convinced by their conscience, went out one by one, from the oldest to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman, where she was, in the middle.
Jesus stood up and saw her and said, "Woman, where are your accusers? No one condemned you? »
She said, "Nobody, Lord." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more. »
Jesus spoke to them again, saying, "I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. »
So the Pharisees said to him, "You testify of yourself. Your testimony is not valid. »
Jesus answered them, "Even though I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true, for I know whence I come and whither I am going; but you, you know neither where I come from nor where I am going.
You judge according to the flesh. I don't judge anyone.
And even if I judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.
It is also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.
I am the one who testifies of myself, and the Father who sent me testifies of me. »
So they said to him, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would also know my Father. »
Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. And no one stopped him, because his time had not yet come.
So Jesus said to them again, "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I am going, you cannot come. »
So the Jews said, "Will he kill himself, because he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come?'"
He said to them, "You are from below. I'm from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.
So I told you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am Him, you will die in your sins. »
So they said to him, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "What I have told you from the beginning.
I have a lot to say and judge about you. But he who sent me is true; and what I have heard from him, I say to the whole world. »
They did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father.
So Jesus said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of man, you will know that it is I, and I do nothing of myself; but it is as my Father has taught me that I say these things.
He who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to Him. »
As he spoke thus, many believed in him.
So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples.
You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. »
They replied, "We are the descendants of Abraham, and we have never been enslaved to anyone. How can you say, "You will be set free"? »
Jesus answered them, "Truly I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave to sin."
A slave does not always remain in the house. A son remains forever.
If, therefore, the Son makes you free, you will be truly free.
I know that you are the seed of Abraham, and yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.
I tell the things that I saw with my Father; and you also do the things you saw with your father. »
They replied, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.
But now you seek to kill me, I who have told you the truth that I have heard from God. It was not Abraham who did this.
You do the works of your father. They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality." We have one Father, God. »
That is why Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me, for I have gone out and come from God. For I did not come of my own accord, but he sent me.
Why don't you understand my word? Because you do not hear my word.
You are your father's devil, and you want to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks of himself, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.
Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?
He who is of God hears the words of God. Therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God. »
Then the Jews answered him, "Do we not say that you are a Samaritan, and that you have a demon?"
Jesus answered, "I have no devil, but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.
But I am not seeking my own glory. There is someone who seeks and judges.
Verily, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death. »
Then the Jews said to him, "We now know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, as are the prophets; and you say, "If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.
Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets are dead. Who do you think you are? »
Jesus answered, "If I glory in myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, whom you say is our God.
You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, "I don't know him," I'd be like you, a liar. But I know him and I keep his word.
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it and rejoiced. »
So the Jews said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham? »
Jesus said to them, "Verily, I say unto you, before Abraham existed, I AM."
So they took stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple, after passing through the midst of them, and so he passed.
As he passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from birth.
His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
Jesus answered, "This man has not sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God may be revealed in him."
I must do, while it is day, the works of him who sent me. Night comes, when no one can work.
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. »
After saying this, he spat on the ground, made mud with his saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with this mud,
and said to him, "Go and wash yourself in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went away, washed himself, and came back seeing .
That is why the neighbors and those who had seen that he was blind before said, "Was it not he who sat and begged?"
Others said, "It is he." Still others said, "He resembles him." He said, "I am him."
So they asked him, "How were your eyes opened?"
He replied, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said, 'Go and wash yourself in the basin of Siloam.' So I left, I washed myself, and I recovered my sight. »
Then they asked him, "Where is he?" He said, "I don't know."
The one who had been blind was brought to the Pharisees.
It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
The Pharisees asked him again how he had recovered his sight. He answered them, "He has put mud on my eyes, I have washed myself, and I see."
Some of the Pharisees, therefore, said, "This man is not of God, because he does not keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner make such signs?" There was therefore division among them.
Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?" He said, "He's a prophet."
So the Jews did not believe about him that he had been blind and had recovered his sight, until they called the relatives of him who had received his sight,
and asked them, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How does he see now? »
His parents replied, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
but we do not know how he sees now, nor who opened his eyes. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak himself. »
His parents said this because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess him as Christ, he should be cast out of the synagogue.
That is why his parents said: "He is of age. Ask him. »
So they called the blind man a second time and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner. »
So he answered, "I don't know if he is a sinner. But I know one thing: I was blind, and now I see. »
They said to him, "What has he done to you? How did he open your eyes? »
He answered them, "I have already told you, and you have not listened. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become his disciples either, do you?
They insulted him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are the disciples of Moses.
We know that God spoke to Moses. But as for this man, we do not know where he comes from. »
The man replied, "It is astonishing! You don't know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.
We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone is a worshipper of God and does His will, he listens to Him.
Since the beginning of the world, it has never been heard of anyone opening the eyes of a man born blind.
If this man did not come from God, he could not do anything. »
They answered him, "You were born entirely in sin, and you teach us?" So they threw him out.
When Jesus heard that they had cast him out, he found him and said to him, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"
He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I should believe in him?"
Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and he is speaking to you."
He said, "Lord, I believe," and he prostrated himself before him.
Jesus said, "I have come into this world to judge, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind."
Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, "Are we also blind?"
Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, "We see." Therefore your sin remains.
"Verily, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but goes up by another way, is a thief and a robber.
But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
The doorkeeper opens the door for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his sheep by name and brings them out.
When he brings out his sheep, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
They will not follow a stranger, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers. »
Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.
So Jesus said to them again, "Verily, I say to you, I am the gate of the sheep.
All those who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, he will come in and out and find pasture.
The thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it in abundance.
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.
He who is a hireling, and not a shepherd, who does not possess the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep and flees. The wolf seizes the sheep and scatters them.
The hireling runs away because he is a hireling and does not take care of the sheep.
I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I am known to my own;
as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.
I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.
That is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, in order to take it back.
No one takes it away from me, but I give it myself. I have the power to give it, and I have the power to take it back. I received this commandment from my Father. »
Therefore there was again a division among the Jews because of these words.
Many of them said, "He has a demon and he is mad! Why do you listen to him? »
Others said, "These are not the words of a demon-possessed. It is not possible for a demon to open the eyes of a blind man, is it? » .
It was the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem.
It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, under the portico of Solomon.
So the Jews surrounded him and said to him, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us frankly. »
Jesus answered them, "I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in the name of my Father bear witness to me.
But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I have told you.
My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me.
I give them eternal life. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them from my hand.
My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.
I and the Father are one. »
So the Jews again took stones to stone him.
Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works of my Father. For which of these works do you stone me? »
The Jews answered him, "It is not for a good work that we stone you, but for blasphemy, for being a man you make yourself God."
Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, 'You are gods?'
If he called them gods, to whom the word of God has come - and the Scripture cannot be broken,
Do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world: "You blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?"
If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.
But if I do them, though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and that I am in the Father. »
They again tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.
He went again beyond the Jordan, to the place where John had first baptized, and he stayed there.
Many people came to him. They said, "John did not work miracles, but all that John said about this man is true."
There, many believed in him.
Now, a man was sick, Lazarus, from Bethany, from the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
It was this Mary, who had anointed the Lord with ointment and had wiped his feet with her hair, with whom brother Lazarus was sick.
So the sisters sent to him, saying, "Lord, behold, he for whom you have a great affection is sick."
But Jesus, having heard this, said, "This sickness is not for death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it."
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
Having heard that the latter was ill, he remained two days in the place where he was.
Then, after this, he said to the disciples, "Let us return to Judea."
The disciples asked him, "Rabbi, the Jews wanted to stone you. Will you go back? »
Jesus answered, "Is there not twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks during the day, he does not flinch, because he sees the light of this world.
But if a man walks during the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. »
He said these things, and after that he said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going to wake him from his sleep."
So the disciples said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he was talking about resting in sleep.
So Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead."
I rejoice for you that you have not been there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let's go to him. »
Thomas, therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his companions in misfortune, "Let us go also, that we may die with him."
When Jesus arrived, he found that he had already been in the tomb for four days.
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.
Many Jews had joined the women who surrounded Martha and Mary, to console them about their brother.
Martha, having heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary remained in the house.
Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
Even now, I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you. »
Jesus said to him, "Your brother will be resurrected."
Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection, on the last day."
Jesus said to him, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even if he dies.
He who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that? »
She said to him, "Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who comes into the world. »
After saying this, she went away and secretly called Mary, her sister, saying, "The Master is here and he is calling you."
Having heard this, she quickly got up and went to him.
Now, Jesus had not yet entered the village, but he was at the place where Martha had met him.
Then the Jews who were with her in the house and comforted her, seeing that Mary was quickly getting up and going out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep."
Therefore, when Mary arrived at the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you had been there, my brother would not have died."
Seeing therefore that she wept, and that the Jews who had come with her wept, Jesus groaned in spirit and was troubled,
and said, "Where did you lay him?" They said to him, "Lord, come and see."
Jesus wept.
So the Jews said, "See what affection he had for him!"
Some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have prevented this man from dying?"
Jesus, groaning again within himself, went to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was placed against it.
Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of the one who had died, said to him, "Lord, there is already a foul smell, for it is four days since he died."
Jesus said to him, "Have I not told you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"
So they removed the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you for listening to me.
I know that you always listen to me, but I said this because of the crowd that was standing there, so that they would believe that you sent me. »
When he had said this, he cried out in a loud voice, "Lazarus, get out of there!"
The one who was dead went out, his hands and feet bound with bandages, and his face was wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Set him free, and let him go."
Therefore many of the Jews, who had come to Mary and seen what Jesus was doing, believed in him.
But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.
Then the chief priests and Pharisees took counsel and said, "What are we doing? For this man does many miracles.
If we leave him thus, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation. »
But a certain Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,
and you do not think that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish. »
He had not said this of himself, but, being high priest that year, he had prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
and not only for the nation, but also to gather into one the scattered children of God.
From that day on, they held a council to put him to death.
So Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the land near the desert, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.
Now, the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.
Then they would look for Jesus, and standing in the temple, they would say to one another, "What do you think he doesn't come to the feast at all?"
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, so that they might seize him.
Six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, where was Lazarus, who had died, and whom he had raised from the dead.
There, they made him a supper. Martha was serving, but Lazarus was among those who were at table with him.
Mary took a pound of ointment of pure spikenard, very precious, and she anointed the feet of Jesus; she wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the smell of perfume.
Then Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, one of his disciples, who was about to betray him, said:
"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"
He said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and having the piggy bank, he was in the habit of stealing what was put in it.
But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. She saved it for the day of my burial.
For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me. »
So a great crowd of Jews heard that he was there, and they came, not only for Jesus' sake, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also,
because, because of him, many Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
The next day, a large crowd came to the party. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
they took the branches of the palm trees, went out to meet her, and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel! »
Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. According to the fact that it is written:
"Fear not, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, seated on a colt. »
His disciples did not at first understand these things; but when Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done them for him.
The crowd that was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, was therefore bearing witness to this.
Therefore also the crowd went to meet him, because they had heard that he had performed this miracle.
Then the Pharisees said to one another, "See how you do nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him. »
Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to prostrate themselves at the feast.
So they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, "Lord, we want to see Jesus."
Philip came to tell Andrew; and Andrew came in his turn with Philip, and they told Jesus.
Jesus answered them, "The time has come when the Son of Man will be glorified.
Truly I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.
He who loves his life will lose it. Whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there will also be my servant. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.
"Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? "Father, save me from this time"? But it is for this reason that I have arrived at this moment.
Father, glorify your name! Then a voice came out of heaven, saying, "I have glorified him and I will glorify him again." »
That's why the crowd that stood there and heard it said it was thunder. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."
Jesus answered, "This voice did not come for my sake, but for your sake.
Now, this is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out.
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to myself. »
But he said this by indicating by what kind of death he was to die.
The crowd replied, "We have learned by the law that Christ abides forever. How do you say, "The Son of Man must be lifted up"? Who is this Son of man? »
So Jesus said to them, "The light is with you for a little while. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.
While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you become children of light. Jesus said these things, and then went away and hid himself from them.
But although he had performed so many miracles before them, they did not believe in him,
that the word which Isaiah the prophet had spoken might be fulfilled: "Lord, who believed our report? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? »
Therefore they could not believe, for Isaiah also said:
"He blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, lest they see with their eyes, and perceive with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them."
Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and he spoke of him.
However, many chiefs believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they might not be excluded from the synagogue,
for they loved the praises of men better than those of God.
Jesus cried out, "He who believes in me does not believe in me, but in him who sent me.
He who sees me sees the one who sent me.
I have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.
If anyone listens to my words and does not believe, I do not judge him. For I have come not to judge the world, but to save the world.
He who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has someone who judges him. The word I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
For I have not spoken of myself, but the Father who sent me has given me a commandment, that I should know what I must say and what I must say.
I know that his commandment is eternal life. The things I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me. »
Now, before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come to leave this world for the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end.
During the meal, the devil having already put in the heart of Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, the desire to betray him,
Jesus, knowing that the Father had put all things into his hands, that he came from God and that he was going to God,
got up from the meal and laid aside his outer clothes. He took a towel and wrapped it around his waist.
Then he poured water into the basin, began to wash the disciples' feet and wipe them with the towel with which he was wrapped.
Then he approached Simon Peter. He said to him, "Lord, are you the one who washes my feet?"
Jesus replied, "You don't know what I'm doing now, but you'll understand later."
Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet!" Jesus replied, "If I do not wash you, you have nothing to do with me."
Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!"
Jesus said to him, "Someone who has bathed only needs to wash his feet, but he is completely pure. You are pure, but not all. »
For he knew the one who was going to betray him; therefore he says, "You are not all clean."
After washing their feet, putting on his outer garment and sitting down, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?
You call me: "Master" and "Lord". You say it well, for I am like that.
If, therefore, I, the Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you must also wash one another's feet.
For I have given you an example, that you should also do as I have done to you.
Truly I say to you, the servant is not greater than his master, nor is the one sent greater than the one who sent him.
If you know these things, you are blessed if you put them into practice.
I am not talking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but it is so that the words of Scripture may be fulfilled: "He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me."
From now on, I tell you before it happens, so that when it happens, you will believe that it is I.
I tell you with all certainty: he who receives him whom I send receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me. »
When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and he said, "I tell you with all certainty, one of you will deliver me up."
The disciples looked at each other, puzzled as to the person he was talking about.
One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at table, leaning against Jesus' breast.
So Simon Peter beckoned him to come, and said to him, "Tell us who he is talking about."
He, leaning as he was on Jesus' breast, asked him, "Lord, who is it?"
So Jesus answered, "He to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have soaked it." So he dipped the piece of bread, and gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.
After the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, "What you do, do it quickly."
Now, no one at the table knew why he was saying this to her.
For some thought, because Judas had the piggy bank, that Jesus had said to him, "Buy what we need for the feast," or that he had to give something to the poor.
Having received this piece, he went out at once. It was night.
When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him."
If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.
Little children, I will stay with you a little longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, "Where I go, you cannot come," I tell you now.
I give you a new commandment: Love one another. As I have loved you, you also, love one another.
By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another. »
Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, but you will follow me afterward."
Peter said to him, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you. »
Jesus answered him, "Will you lay down your life for me? Verily, I say to you, the will not crow until you have denied me three times.
"Don't let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe in me too.
In my Father's house, there are several houses. If it were not so, I would have told you. I'll prepare a place for you.
If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and receive you at my house, so that where I am, you will also be there.
You know where I am going, and you know the way. »
Thomas said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way? »
Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him and you have seen him. »
Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."
Jesus said to him, "I have been with you so long, and you do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, "Show us the Father"?
Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I speak to you, I do not speak of myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.
Believe me that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me; or believe me because of the works themselves.
Truly I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do, and he will do greater works, because I am going to my Father.
Whatever you ask in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
If you ask for anything on my behalf, I will do it.
If you love me, keep my commandments.
I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another counselor, that he may abide with you forever:
the Spirit of truth, which the world cannot receive, because it does not see it and does not know it. You know him, for he dwells with you and he will be in you.
I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.
A little while longer, and the world will see me no more; but you, you will see me. Because I live, you will live too.
In that day, you will know that I am in my Father, that you are in me, and that I am in you.
He who has my commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves me. Whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and I will reveal myself to him. »
Judas (and not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, what has happened that you reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"
Jesus answered him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make our home with him.
He who does not love me does not keep my words. The word you hear is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me.
"I told you these things while I was still living with you.
But the counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of all that I have said to you.
I leave you in peace. It is my peace that I give you; it is not that which the world I give you gives. Let not your heart be troubled and may it not be afraid.
You have heard how I said to you: "I am going away, and I will return to you". If you loved me, you would rejoice in what I said, "I am going to my Father," for the Father is greater than I.
Now I told you this before it happened, so that when it happens, you may believe.
I will not speak much more with you, for the prince of the world is coming, and he has nothing in me.
But that the world may know that I love the Father, and that I do what the Father has commanded me. Get up, let us get out of here.
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator.
Every branch that is in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes, so that it bears even more fruit.
You are already pruned, because of the word I have spoken to you.
Stay in me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in me.
I am the vine. You are the branches. He who abides in me and in whom I abide bears much fruit, for outside of me you can do nothing.
If a man does not abide in me, he is cast up like a branch and withers; it is picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.
If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it will be granted to you.
"My Father is glorified in that you bear much fruit; so you will be my disciples.
As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Abide in my love.
If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, as I have kept the commandments of my Father and abide in his love.
I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may abide in you, and that your joy may be complete.
"This is my commandment: Love one another, as I have loved you.
There is no greater love than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.
You are my friends, if you do all that I command you.
I no longer call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.
It is not you who have chosen me, but I who have chosen and appointed you, that you may go and bear fruit, and that your fruit may remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.
I command you these things, that you may love one another.
If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.
If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, because I have chosen you out of the world, that is why the world hates you.
Remember the word I spoke to you: "A servant is not greater than his master." If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they have kept my word, they will also keep yours.
But they will do all these things to you for my name's sake, because they do not know him who sent me.
If I had not come to speak to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
He who hates me, hates my Father also.
If I had not done among them the works that no one else has done, they would not have had sin. But now they have seen and they have also hated both me and my Father.
But this happened in order that the word that was written in their law might be fulfilled: "They hated me without cause.
When the counselor comes whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father, he will bear witness to me.
You also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.
"I have told you these things so that you may not be misled.
You will be chased out of the synagogues. Yes, the time is coming when the one who kills you will think that he is offering a service to God.
They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me.
But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes you may remember that I have spoken to you about them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you ask me, "Where are you going?"
But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.
But I tell you the truth: it is advantageous for you that I go away, for if I do not go, the counselor will not come to you. But if I leave, I will send it to you.
When he comes, he will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and judgment;
concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;
concerning righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you will see me no more;
concerning the judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
I still have many things to tell you, but you can't stand them now.
But when the Spirit of truth comes, he will lead you into all truth; for he will not speak of himself, but he will say all that he has heard. He will tell you the things that are to happen.
He will glorify me, for he will take of what is mine and declare it to you.
All that the Father has is mine; Therefore I have said that he takes of what is mine and will declare it to you.
"A little more time, and you won't see me. A little more time, and you will see me. »
So some of his disciples said to one another, "What does it mean that he says to us, 'A little while longer, and you will not see me; and a little more time, and you will see me; and: "Because I am going to the Father"? »
So they said, "What does it mean that he says, 'A little time?' We don't know what he says. »
Jesus understood that they wanted to question him, and he said to them, "You are asking yourselves what I have said: 'A little while longer, and you will not see me; then a little more time, and you will see me."
Verily, I say to you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice. You will be in sadness, but your sadness will turn into joy.
The woman, when she gives birth, is sad, for her hour has come. But when she gave birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, because of the joy that comes from the birth of a human being in the world.
Therefore you are now in sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.
"On that day, you will no longer ask me questions. Verily I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give you.
So far, you have not asked for anything on my behalf. Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
"I have told you these things in figures of rhetoric. But the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in words, but when I will speak to you clearly of the Father.
In that day you shall ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,
for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and believed that I came from God.
I came from the Father and I came into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father. »
His disciples said to him, "Behold, you speak clearly and without a figure of speech.
We now know that you know everything, and that you don't need to be questioned. That is why we believe that you came from God. »
Jesus answered them, "Do you believe now?
Behold, the time is coming, and it has already come, when you will be scattered, each to his own, and when you will leave me alone. But I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
I have spoken these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world, you have difficulties; but take courage! I have conquered the world."
Jesus said these things, and then, raising his eyes to heaven, he said, "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, so that your Son also may glorify you.
As you have given him authority over all flesh, so he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
Eternal life is that they may know you, the only true God, and the one whom you have sent, Jesus Christ.
I have glorified you on earth. I have done the work that you gave me to do.
Now, Father, glorify me to yourself with the glory I had with you before the world existed.
"I have revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me. They have kept your word.
They now know that everything you have given me comes from you,
for the words which thou hast given me, I have given them; they received them, and they knew for sure that I came from you. They thought you had sent me.
I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
All that is mine is yours, and you are mine, and I am glorified in them.
I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep them by your name which you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. I have kept the ones you gave me. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture may be fulfilled.
But now I come to you, and I speak these things in the world, that they may have my perfect joy in themselves.
I have given them your word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
I do not pray you to take them out of the world, but to preserve them from the evil one.
They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.
As you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world.
For their sake I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth.
It is not only for them that I pray, but also for those who will believe in me by their word,
that they may all be one, as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, so that they also may be one in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
The glory which thou hast given me, I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one,
I in them, and you in me, that they may become one, so that the world may know that you have sent me and that you have loved them as you have loved me.
Father, I desire that those whom you have given me should also be with me where I am, that they may see the glory you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.
Righteous Father, the world did not know you, but I knew you, and they knew that you had sent me.
I have made your name known to them, and I will make it known, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and that I may be in them. »
When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples to the other side of the Kidron stream, where there was a garden, into which he entered with his disciples.
Judas, who betrayed him, also knew this place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples.
Judas, therefore, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees, came thither with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
So Jesus, knowing all that was happening to him, went out and said to them, "Whom are you looking for?"
They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am he." Judas, who betrayed him, also stood with them.
When he said to them, "It is I," they stepped back and fell to the ground.
So he asked them again, "Whom are you looking for?" They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
Jesus replied, "I told you it was I. If you seek me, let them go."
that the word which he has spoken may be fulfilled, "Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none."
Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. The name of the servant was Malchus.
Jesus then said to Peter, "Put the sword back in its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me? »
So the detachment, the commander and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus, bound him,
and took him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was fitting that one man should perish for the people.
Simon Peter followed Jesus, as well as another disciple. Now this disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
but Pierre stood at the door, outside. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the servant who guarded the door, and brought Peter in.
Then the maid who was guarding the door said to Peter, "Are you also one of this man's disciples?" He said, "I'm not."
Now the servants and officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They warmed up. Peter was with them, standing and warming himself.
So the high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always gather. I didn't say anything in secret.
Why do you question me? Ask those who heard me what I told them. Here they know the things I have said. »
When he had said this, one of the officers who was standing there struck Jesus with his hand, saying, "Is this how you answer the high priest?"
Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken evil, testify to evil; but if I have spoken well, why do you strike me? »
Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.
Now Simon Peter was standing up and warming himself. So they said to him, "You are not also one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it and said, "I'm not."
One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "Did I not see you with him in the garden?"
So Peter denied him again, and immediately the crowed.
So they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium. It was early, and they themselves did not enter the courtroom, so as not to defile themselves, but to be able to eat the Passover.
So Pilate went out to them and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?"
They replied, "If this man were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you."
Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law." That is why the Jews said to him, "We are forbidden to put anyone to death."
that the word of Jesus, which he had spoken, might be fulfilled, indicating by what kind of death he was to die.
So Pilate went into the praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
Jesus answered him, "You say this to yourself, or have others told you about me?"
Pilate replied, "I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you up to me. What did you do? »
Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now, my Kingdom is not of this world. »
So Pilate said to him, "Are you a king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. That is why I was born, and that is why I came into the world, to bear witness to the truth. All who are of the truth listen to my voice. »
Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I find no reason to accuse him.
But it is your custom for me to deliver someone to you at the Passover. Do you want me to release the king of the Jews to you? »
Then they all cried out again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a brigand.
Pilate then took Jesus and had him whipped.
The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, which they put on his head, and clothed him with a purple garment.
They kept saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and slapping him.
Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I bring him to you, that you may know that I find no reason to accuse him."
So Jesus went out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Behold the man!"
When the chief priests and ushers saw him, they cried out, and said, "Crucify! Crucified! Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no reason to accuse him." »
The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he must die, because he has made himself the Son of God."
When Pilate heard these words, he was even more afraid.
He went into the praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus did not answer him.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not speak to me? Don't you know that I have the power to set you free and that I have the power to crucify you? »
Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has a greater sin. »
At that time, Pilate was trying to release him, but the Jews cried out, "If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend! Whoever makes himself king speaks against Caesar! »
As soon as Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the seat of the tribunal, in a place called "the Pavement," but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha."
Now it was the day of the preparation of the Passover, about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"
They cried out, "Let him be driven away! Let us take him! Crucify him! Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests replied, "We have no king but Caesar!" »
Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and took him away.
He went out, carrying his cross, to go to the place called "place of the skull," which is called in Hebrew "Golgotha."
where they crucified him, together with two other persons, on each side, and Jesus in the middle.
Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. It was written: "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS".
Many Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The king of the Jews,' but, 'He said, 'I am the king of the Jews.'
Pilate replied, "What I have written, I have written."
The soldiers, after crucifying Jesus, took his garments and made four parts of them, one part for each soldier, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven from top to bottom.
Then they said to one another, "Let us not tear it up, but let us cast lots to whom it shall belong," so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, "They have divided my garments among themselves. They drew lots for my clothes. That's why the soldiers did these things.
But near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary, wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son."
Then he said to the disciple, "Behold your mother." From that hour the disciple took her into his home.
After this, Jesus, seeing that all was now finished, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty!"
A vase full of vinegar was placed there; a sponge full of vinegar was put on some hyssop, and it was brought to his mouth.
When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." Then he lowered his head and gave up his mind.
The Jews, as it was the day of preparation, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was special), asked Pilate to break their legs and carry them away.
So the soldiers came to break the legs of the first and the other who had been crucified with him.
But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
He who has seen has given his testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you may believe.
For these things have come to pass in order that the Scripture may be fulfilled: "None of his bones shall be broken."
Yet another Scripture says, "They shall look upon him whom they have pierced."
After this, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but in secret out of fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to be allowed to take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away the body of Jesus.
Nicodemus, who had first come to see Jesus by night, also came to bring a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds.
So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it with the spices in cloths, according to the Jewish custom of burying it.
Now, in the place where he had been crucified, there was a garden. In this garden was a new tomb, in which no man had ever been put before.
Then, because of the day of the preparation of the Jews (for the tomb was near), they laid Jesus there.
On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, as it was still night, to the sepulchre, and she saw that the stone had been removed from the sepulchre.
So she ran and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him."
So Peter and the other disciple went out and went to the tomb.
They were both running together. The other disciple preceded Peter and arrived first at the tomb.
Bending down to look, he saw the linen cloths that were there; but he did not enter.
Then Simon Peter, who followed him, entered the tomb. He saw the linen lying down,
and the linen that had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linens, but rolled up in a separate place.
Then the other disciple, who had arrived first at the tomb, also entered; he saw and believed.
For they did not yet know the Scripture, according to which he must rise from the dead.
So the disciples went home.
Mary was standing outside, near the tomb, and she was weeping. As she wept, she stooped down and looked into the tomb,
and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.
They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" She said to them, "Because they have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have put him."
Saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and she did not know that it was Jesus.
Jesus said to her, "Woman, why do you weep? Who are you looking for? She, supposing it to be the gardener, said to him, "Sir, if you have taken it away, tell me where you have deposited it, and I will take it away." »
Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned around and said, "Rabboni!" which means, "Master!"
Jesus said to him, "Do not detain me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God." »
Mary Magdalene came to announce to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things to her.
On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors of the place where the disciples were assembled being locked, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and placed himself in the midst of them and said to them, "Peace be with you."
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. So the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
Jesus then said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you. »
When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit."
If you forgive someone's sins, they are forgiven them. If you retain someone's sins, they have been retained. »
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
So the other disciples said to him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the imprint of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the imprint of the nails, and put my hand in his side, I will not believe."
Eight days later, his disciples were back inside and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, placed himself in the middle and said, "Peace be with you."
Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger out here, and look at my hands. Draw your hand here, and put it in my side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing. »
Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"
Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and who have believed. »
Jesus performed many other miracles in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;
but these things were written so that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you might have life in his name.
After these things, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples on the Sea of Galilee. He thus revealed himself.
Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael, of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples were together.
Simon Peter said to them, "I am going to fish." They said to him, "We also come with you." They immediately went out and entered the boat. That night, they took nothing.
But, as the day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
So Jesus said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?" They said, "No."
He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." So they threw it away, and now they could not pull it for the multitude of fish.
So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped himself in his cloak, for he was naked, and threw himself into the sea.
But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net full of fish.
When they came to dry land, they saw there a fire of coals, with fish and bread laid on it.
Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."
Simon Peter climbed up and drew ashore the net, full of one hundred and fifty-three large fish. Even though there were so many, the net did not tear.
Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Lord.
Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, as well as the fish.
This is now the third time that Jesus reveals himself to his disciples after his resurrection from the dead.
After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I have affection for you. He said to him, "Feed my lambs." »
He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I have affection for you. He said to him, "Serve my sheep." »
He said to him for the third time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you have any affection for me?" Peter was grieved because he asked him for the third time, "Do you have any affection for me?" He replied, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you. Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."
Truly, I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go. »
Now he said this to signify by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, "Follow me."
Then Peter, turning round, saw a disciple following him. This was the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast during the meal and asked, "Lord, who is going to betray you?"
Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?"
Jesus said to him, "If I want him to stay until I come, what does it matter to you? You follow me. »
Therefore this word spread among the brethren, that this disciple would not die. Now Jesus did not tell him that he would not die, but, "If I desire him to stay until I come, what does it matter to you?"
This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and who wrote these things. We know that his testimony is true.
There are also many other things that Jesus did, and if they were all written, I guess the world itself would have no room for the books that would be written.
The first book I wrote, Theophilus, is about everything that Jesus began to do and teach,
until the day when he was received, after having given his orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
It was to them also that he showed himself alive, after having suffered, by many proofs, by appearing to them for forty days and speaking to them of the kingdom of God.
Then he met with them, and commanded them, "Do not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard from me."
For John baptized in water, but you, in a few days, will be baptized in the Holy Spirit. »
Wherefore, when they came together, they asked him, "Lord, is it now that you restore the kingdom of Israel?"
He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times and seasons that the Father has appointed of his own accord.
But you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit is descended upon you. You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. »
When they had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken away, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.
As they stared at the sky as he went away, behold, two men in white garments stood near them.
They also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand there looking at the sky? This Jesus, who was taken from you into heaven, will return in the same way you saw him go into heaven. »
Then they returned to Jerusalem, from the mountain called Olives, which is near Jerusalem, at the distance of a Sabbath day.
After their arrival, they went up to the upper room where they were staying, that is, Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James, son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas, son of James.
All these, with one accord, persevered in prayer and supplication, as well as the women, Mary, mother of Jesus, and her brothers.
In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (whose number was about one hundred and twenty), and said:
Brethren, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit had already announced by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as a guide to those who had taken Jesus.
For he was numbered among us, and he received his share in this ministry.
Now this man has procured a field for himself with the reward of his wickedness; and, falling head first, his body opened and all his intestines gushed out.
All the inhabitants of Jerusalem learned that, in their language, this field was called "Akeldama", that is, "field of blood".
For it is written in the book of Psalms, "Let his dwelling be desolate. Let no one live there. and, "Let another take his post.
"Of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus has entered and gone forth among us,
from the baptism of John until the day he was received from among us, one of them must become a witness of his resurrection with us. »
They presented two: Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.
They prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which of these two you have chosen
to participate in this ministry and apostolate of which Judas has divested himself, so that he may go in his place. »
Lots were cast for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered among the eleven apostles.
On the day of Pentecost, they were all together in the same place.
Suddenly there came from heaven a noise like the breath of a great wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
Tongues like tongues of fire appeared and were distributed to them, and there was one on each of them.
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, according as the Spirit gave them the faculty of speaking.
Now there were Jews in Jerusalem, pious men, from all the nations that are under heaven.
When this noise was heard, the crowd assembled and was disconcerted, for each one heard them speaking in his own language.
They were all astonished and astonished, saying to one another, "Behold, are not all those who speak Galileans?
How do we hear each in his or her mother tongue?
Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
of Phrygia, of Pamphylia, of Egypt, of the vicinity of Cyrene in Libya, of the visitors of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
Cretans and Arabs, we hear them speak in our languages of the wonders of God. »
They were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
Others, mockingly, said, "They are filled with new wine."
But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, "Men of Judea and all you who dwell in Jerusalem, know this and listen to my words.
For these are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.
But this is what was announced by the prophet Joel:
"It will be so in the last days," says God, "that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your young men will have visions. Your old men will have dreams.
Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaids in those days, I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
I will make wonders appear in the heavens above, and signs on the earth below: blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.
The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.
Whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
"Men of Israel, listen to these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God in your eyes, by the miracles, wonders, and signs that God has done through him in your midst, as you yourselves know,
he who, delivered up according to the fixed plan and foreknowledge of God, was taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed,
whom God raised from the dead, delivering him from the torment of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.
For David said of him, I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand, so that I should not be moved.
Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover, my flesh also will dwell in hope,
for you will not leave my soul in hell, nor will you allow your Saint to see the decay.
You have made me know the paths of life. You will fill me with joy by your presence."
"Brethren, I can tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he died and was buried, and that his tomb is still with us today.
Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him by oath that from the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne,
foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ, so that his soul might not remain in hell and his flesh might not see decay.
God raised this Jesus, of which we are all witnesses.
Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he poured out what you now see and hear.
For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself said, The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand."
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. »
"Let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified."
When they heard this, they were heartbroken, and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?"
Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
For the promise is for you, for your children, and for all those who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to him. »
With many other words, he bore witness to them and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation!"
Then those who received his word with joy were baptized. On that day, there were about three thousand more souls.
They persevered in the teaching of the apostles and in fraternal communion, in the breaking of bread and in prayer.
Fear took hold of all, and many wonders and miracles were done by the apostles.
All those who believed were together, and had everything in common.
They sold their goods and property, and distributed them to all, according to the needs of each.
Every day, persevering with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread in the houses, they took their food with joy and simplicity of heart,
praised God and were favored by all the people. The Lord added to the congregation every day those who were saved.
Peter and John went up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
A lame man was carried from his mother's womb, which was deposited every day at the door of the temple called the Beautiful, to ask for gifts for the needy from those who entered the temple.
Seeing Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy.
Peter, fixing his eyes on him, said with John, "Look at us."
He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.
But Peter said, "I have neither silver nor gold; but what I have, I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk! »
He took him by the right hand and made him stand up. Immediately, his feet and the bones of his ankles regained their strength.
With a bound, he got up and began to walk. He entered the temple with them, walking, jumping, and praising God.
All the people saw him walking and praising God.
They recognized him: he was the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg for donations for the needy. They were amazed and stunned by what had happened to him.
As the lame man who had been healed clung to Peter and John, all the people ran to them in the portico called Solomon, in great astonishment.
When Peter saw him, he answered the people, "Men of Israel, why are you astonished at this man? Why do you fix your eyes on us, as if we had made him walk by our own strength or piety?
The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and denied before Pilate, who had decided to release him.
But you have denied the Holy and the Righteous and asked that you be granted a murderer,
and you have killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
It is by faith in his name that this man, whom you see and know, has been made strong. Yes, the faith that is in him has given him this perfect solidity in the presence of all of you.
"Now, brethren, I know that you have done this out of ignorance, as have your leaders.
But what God had announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ was to suffer, he has fulfilled.
Repent therefore and return, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,
and that he may send Jesus Christ, who was ordained for you before,
and that heaven is to receive until the time of restitution of all things, of which God spoke long ago through the mouth of his holy prophets.
Moses said to the fathers, "The Lord God will raise up for you from among your brethren a prophet like me. You will listen to him in everything he tells you.
Any soul that does not listen to this prophet will be exterminated from the people.
Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who followed, all who spoke, also spoke of those days.
You are the children of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, "All the families of the earth will be blessed by your seed."
God, who raised up his servant Jesus, first sent him to you to bless you, turning each one of you away from his wickedness. »
As they were speaking to the people, the priests, the commander of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them,
dissatisfied with the fact that they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
They laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, for evening was falling.
But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of these men amounted to about five thousand.
In the morning, the rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem.
The high priest Hannah was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all those who were related to the high priest.
After placing Peter and John in the midst of them, they asked them, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,
If we are asked today about a benefit done to a cripple, about the manner in which this man was healed,
let it be known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, and whom God raised from the dead, this man stands here before you wholly in him.
He is "the stone that you, the builders, regarded as worthless, and which has become the head of the corner".
There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men, by which we must be saved! »
Now when they saw the audacity of Peter and John, and understood that they were ignorant and uneducated men, they were astonished. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.
And seeing that the healed man was standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
But after ordering them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin, they consulted among themselves.
saying, "What shall we do to these men? For, indeed, a remarkable miracle has been wrought by them, as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem clearly see, and we cannot deny it.
But lest this may spread further among the people, let us threaten them, so that henceforth they may speak to no one in this name. »
They called them and ordered them not to speak at all or to teach in the name of Jesus.
But Peter and John answered them, "If it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to listen to God, judge for yourselves,
for we cannot help recounting the things we have seen and heard. »
After making them new threats, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, for the people's sake; for all glorified God for what had happened.
For the man on whom this miracle of healing occurred was more than forty years old.
After they had been released, they returned to them and related all that the chief priests and elders had told them.
When they heard him, they raised their voices with one accord to God and said, "Lord, you are God, you who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
you who, through the mouth of your servant David, said, "Why are the nations angry? and the people plot in vain?
The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers plot together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.
"For Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, have leagued against your holy servant Jesus, whom you have anointed,
to do all that your hand and your council have decided to accomplish.
Now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant that your servants may speak your word boldly,
while thou stretches out thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed in the name of thy holy servant Jesus. »
After they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
The multitude of those who believed had but one heart and one soul. None of them claimed that any part of what he possessed belonged to him in his own right, but they had everything in common.
With great power, the apostles bore witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. A great grace rested upon them all.
For there was no needy person among them, for all those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the proceeds of their sale,
and laid him at the feet of the apostles; and it was distributed to each according to his needs.
Joses, nicknamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means, according to the interpretation, Son of encouragement), Levite, originally from Cyprus,
having a field, sold it, brought the money, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
Now a man named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold a property,
and retained a part of the prize; his wife also knew this, and then she brought some of it and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
But Peter said, Annanias, why did Satan fill your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to withhold a portion of the price of the land?
As long as you kept it, did it not remain yours? After its sale, was it not in your power? How is it that you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God. »
Ananias, hearing these words, fell and died. Great fear took hold of all who heard these things.
The young men, having risen, enveloped him, carried him away, and buried him.
About three hours later, his wife, who did not know what had happened, came in.
Peter said to him, "Tell me if you sold the land at such a price." She said, "Yes, for so many things."
But Peter said to him, "How is it that you have agreed to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out. »
She immediately fell at his feet and died. The young men entered and found her dead; they carried her out and buried her near her husband.
Great fear took hold of the whole assembly and of all those who heard these things.
Through the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were performed among the people. They were all by common consent under the portico of Solomon.
None of the others dared to join them, but the people honored them.
More and more believers joined the Lord, multitudes of men and women.
The sick were even carried through the streets and laid on beds and mattresses, so that when Peter passed by, his shadow at least covered some of them.
The crowd also gathered from the cities near Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits; and all were healed.
But the high priest arose, and all those who were with him (this is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy
and laid their hands on the apostles, and then put them in public prison.
But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison by night, brought them out, and said to them:
"Go and stand and speak to the people in the temple of all the words of this life."
After hearing this, they entered the temple around dawn and taught. But the high priest and those who were with him came to summon the council, with all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought in.
But the officers who had come did not find them in the prison. They returned and made this report:
"We found the prison closed and locked, and the guards standing before the doors; but when we opened them, we couldn't find anyone inside! » .
Now, when the high priest, the commander of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might result from them.
Someone came and said to them, "Behold, the men whom you have put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."
Then the captain went with the officers and brought them back without violence, for they feared that the people would stone them.
When they had brought them, they presented them to the Sanhedrin. The high priest questioned them,
saying, "Have we not strictly commanded you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to make the blood of this man fall upon us. »
But Peter and the apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than men.
The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead, whom you killed by hanging him on the tree.
God raised him up by his right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
We are his witnesses of these things, as well as the Holy Spirit, which God has given to those who obey him. »
But when they heard this, their hearts were squeezed, and they were resolved to put them to death.
But someone arose in the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, honored by all the people, and ordered the apostles to be put aside for a little while.
He said to them, "Men of Israel, beware of these men, of what you are going to do.
For, before these days, Theudas arose, pretending to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who obeyed him were scattered and reduced to nothing.
After this man, Judas of Galilee arose at the time of the inscription, and he dragged some people after him. He also perished, and all those who obeyed him were scattered.
Now, I say to you, withdraw from these men and leave them alone. For if this counsel or work be of men, it will be overthrown.
But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it, and it would even be found that you are fighting against God! » .
They agreed with him. They summoned the apostles, beat them, commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.
So they withdrew from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been judged worthy to suffer reproach for Jesus' name.
Every day, in the temple and in the homes, they did not cease to teach and preach Jesus, the Christ.
In those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenes against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.
The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, "It is not fitting that we should forsake the word of God to serve tables.
Choose from among you, brethren, seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we will name responsible for this matter.
But we will continue to persevere in prayer and in the ministry of the word. »
These words pleased the whole crowd. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas, a proselyte of Antioch,
which they set before the apostles. After praying, they laid their hands on them.
The word of God increased and the number of disciples multiplied in Jerusalem. A large part of the priests obeyed the faith.
Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and miracles among the people.
But some of those of the synagogue called the Libertines, the Cyreneans, the Alexandrians, the Cilicians, and the Asiatics, rose up to dispute with Stephen.
They could not resist the wisdom and Spirit through which he spoke.
Then they sent word secretly to men, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God."
They stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and came against him. They seized him, and then brought him before the council,
and set false witnesses who said, "This man does not cease to utter blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.
For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us. »
All those who sat in the council, fixing their eyes on him, saw his face like that of an angel.
The high priest said, "Are these things true?"
He said, "Brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
and he said to him, "Leave your country and your family, and come to a land that I will show you."
So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after the death of his father, God brought him to this country where you now live.
He gave him no inheritance, not even enough to set foot on it. He promised to give it to him as property, as well as to his descendants after him, when he had not yet had any children.
God spoke thus: His descendants would live as strangers in a foreign land, and they would be enslaved and abused for four hundred years.
I will judge the nation to which they shall be enslaved, saith God, and after that they shall go forth and serve me in that place.
He gave her the covenant of circumcision. Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
"The patriarchs, impelled by jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him
and delivered him from all his afflictions, he gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt. He made him governor of Egypt and of all his household.
Now there came famine and great distress throughout the land of Egypt and Canaan. Our fathers found no food.
But when Jacob heard that there was wheat in Egypt, he sent our fathers for the first time.
The second time, Joseph was known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was revealed to Pharaoh.
Joseph sent and summoned Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls.
Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers;
they were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought for money from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.
But as the time of God's promise to Abraham drew near, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt.
until another king came along who did not know Joseph.
He took advantage of our race and ill-treated our fathers, and forced them to abandon their babies, so that they would not remain alive.
At that time Moses was born, who was exceedingly beautiful in the eyes of God. He was fed for three months in his father's house.
When he was abandoned, the Pharaoh's daughter took him in and raised him as her own son.
Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was powerful in his words and in his works.
But when he was forty years old, it occurred to him to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
Seeing that one of them was wronged, he defended him and avenged the oppressed, by striking the Egyptian.
He supposed that his brothers understood that God, through his hand, granted them deliverance; but they did not understand.
"The next day, he appeared to them while they were fighting, and exhorted them to find peace, saying, 'Gentlemen, you are brothers.
But the one who wronged his neighbor repulsed him, saying, "Who has made you ruler and judge over us?
Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?
At this word Moses fled and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
"When forty years had passed, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire, in a bush.
When Moses saw him, he was amazed by the sight. As he drew near to see, the voice of the Lord came to him:
"I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob". Moses trembled and did not dare to look.
The Lord said to him, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt and I have heard their groaning. I went down to deliver them. Come now, I will send you to Egypt."
This Moses whom they refused, saying, "Who made you ruler and judge?" God sent him as ruler and deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
It was he who led them, after having performed wonders and signs in Egypt, to the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
It was this Moses who said to the children of Israel: "The Lord our God will raise up for you from among your brethren a prophet like me."
He was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living revelations to transmit to us,
and whom our fathers would not obey, but whom they rejected and returned to Egypt in their hearts,
saying to Aaron, "Make us gods who go before us, for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.
In those days they made a calf, offered a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the work of their hands.
But God turned away from them and delivered them into the service of the army of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets, "Have you offered me dead animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, house of Israel?
You have set up the tabernacle of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan, the figures you have made to worship, then I will take you beyond Babylon.
Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to build it after the pattern he had seen.
Our fathers, in their turn, brought it with Joshua, when they came into possession of the nations whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David,
who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
But Solomon built him a house.
But the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,
"Heaven is my throne, and earth is a footstool for my feet. What kind of house are you going to build for me? says the Lord. Or where is my resting place?
Didn't my hand do all these things?
"Men of stiff necks, uncircumcised in heart and ear, you are still resisting the Holy Spirit! You are doing what your fathers did.
Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? They have killed those who announced the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become traitors and murderers.
You have received the law as it was ordained by the angels, and you have not kept it! » .
But when they heard these things, they were heartbroken, and they gnashed their teeth against him.
But he, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked fixedly to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,
and he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."
But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears, and then rushed at him with one accord.
They threw him out of the city and stoned him. The witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
They stoned Stephen, who cried out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
He knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them!" After saying this, he fell asleep.
Saul consented to his death. A great persecution arose against the congregation which was in Jerusalem that day. They were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.
Pious men buried Stephen and lamented his fate.
But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering all the houses and dragging men and women to prison.
So those who were scattered went from place to place preaching the word.
Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.
The crowd listened with one accord to the words of Philip, when they heard and saw the miracles he performed.
For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out shouting in a loud voice. Many of the paralyzed and lame were healed.
There was great joy in this city.
Now there was in the city a man named Simon, who used to practice sorcery and astonish the inhabitants of Samaria, pretending to be a great man,
and that all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the great power of God."
They listened to him, because he had long since astonished them by his spells.
But when they believed that Philip was preaching the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, men and women.
Simon himself also believed . After being baptized, he continued his journey with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles happening, he was amazed.
The apostles who were in Jerusalem, when they heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent Peter and John there.
The latter, having come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;
for he had not yet fallen upon any of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
Simon, seeing that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of hands of the apostles, offered them money,
saying, "Give me this power also, that whosoever layeth his hands upon me may receive the Holy Ghost."
But Peter said to him, "Let your money perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money.
You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
Repent therefore of this, of your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart can be forgiven you.
For I see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity. »
Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me."
After they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News in several villages of the Samaritans.
Then an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Arise, and go to the south, on the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza. It's a desert. »
He got up and left. And behold, a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was at the head of all his treasure, had come to Jerusalem to prostrate himself.
He would return, sitting in his chariot, and read the prophet Isaiah.
The Spirit said to Philip, "Draw near, and cleave to this chariot."
Philip ran to him, heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, "Do you understand what you read?"
He said, "How can I do it, if no one explains it to me?" He begged Philip to come up and sit down with him.
Now, the passage of Scripture he was reading was this, "He was led like a sheep to the slaughterhouse. Like a lamb that is silent before its shearer, so that he does not open his mouth.
In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away. Who will declare his generation? For his life is taken from the earth. »
The eunuch answered Philip, "Of whom does the prophet speak? Of himself, or of someone else? »
Philip opened his mouth, and, beginning with this Scripture, he announced Jesus to him.
As they went on their way, they came to water, and the eunuch said, "Here is water. What prevents me from being baptized? »
He ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
When they came out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went away joyfully.
But Philip was found at Azotus. As he passed, he preached the good news in all the cities, until he arrived at Caesarea.
But Saul, who continued to utter threats and slaughter the Lord's disciples, went to the high priest
and asked him for letters for the synagogues of Damascus, so that, if he found men or women of the Way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
As he traveled, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.
He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
He said, "Who are you, Lord?" The Lord says, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
But get up and go into the city; then you will be told what you should do. »
The men who were travelling with him were speechless, hearing the noise, but seeing no one.
Saul rose from the ground, and his eyes were opened, but he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and brought him to Damascus.
He remained three days without seeing, and he neither ate nor drank.
Now there was in Damascus a disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias!" He said, "Behold, it is I, Lord."
The Lord said to him, "Get up, go to the street called Straight, and look in the house of Judah for a man named Saul, a native of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying,
and he saw in a vision a man, named Ananias, enter and lay his hands on him, that he might recover his sight. »
But Ananias spoke up and said, "Lord, many have told me about this man, and how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.
He has power here from the chief priests to bind all those who call on your name. »
But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is the vessel which I have chosen to bear my name before the nations and kings, and before the children of Israel.
For I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake. »
Ananias went away and entered the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the way you came, has sent me to receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he recovered his sight. He arose and was baptized.
He took food and was strengthened. Saul stayed several days with the disciples who were in Damascus.
Immediately, in the synagogues, he proclaimed Christ, that he is the Son of God.
All who heard him were amazed and said, "Was it not he who in Jerusalem wronged those who called on that name? And he had come here with the intention of bringing them bound before the chief priests! » .
But Saul grew stronger and stronger, and he confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that it was Christ.
Several days having passed, the Jews formed a plot to put him to death.
But Saul got wind of their plan. They watched the gates day and night, in order to kill him.
But his disciples took him by night, brought him down the wall, and lowered him in a basket.
When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he told them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and how he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
He entered with them into Jerusalem,
and boldly preached in the name of the Lord Jesus. He talked and disputed with the Hellenists, but they sought to put him to death.
When the brothers heard of this, they sent him down to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.
Thus in all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria the assemblies knew peace and were edified. They multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
As Peter was travelling through all these countries, he also went down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda.
There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years because he was paralyzed.
Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed! Immediately, he got up.
All the inhabitants of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they were converted to the Lord.
Now there was a disciple in Joppa named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy that she performed.
At that time, she fell ill and died. After washing it, it was placed in an upper room.
As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, begging him not to delay in coming to join them.
Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they brought him into the upper room. All the widows stood by him, weeping, and showing the tunics and other garments that Dorcas had made while she was with them.
Peter brought them out, then he knelt down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, get up!" She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she straightened up.
He gave her his hand and made her stand up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
This spread throughout the city of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
He stayed several days at Joppa with a currier named Simon.
There was at Caesarea a man named Cornelius, centurion of what was called the regiment of Italy,
a pious and God-fearing man with all his household, who generously gave gifts to the people for the needy and who always prayed to God.
About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, "Cornelius!"
He, fixing his eyes on him and frightened, said, "What is the matter, Lord?" He said to him, "Your prayers and gifts to the needy have gone up in remembrance before God.
Now send men to Joppa, and bring Simon, who is also called Peter.
He is at the house of a currier, named Simon, whose house is by the sea.
When the angel who had spoken to him was gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a pious soldier from among those who served him continually.
After explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
The next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up to the roof of the house to pray about noon.
He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
He saw the heavens open and a vessel descending towards him, like a great sheet spread out from the four corners on the earth,
in which were found all kinds of quadrupedal animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds of the air.
A voice spoke to him: "Arise, Peter, kill and eat!"
But Peter said, "No, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common or unclean."
The second time, a voice was heard: "What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean."
This was done three times, and immediately the thing was received in heaven.
When Peter was very perplexed as to the meaning of the vision he had seen, behold, the men sent by Cornelius, having inquired about the house of Simon, presented themselves before the door,
and called to ask if Simon, also called Peter, was lodged there.
While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you.
But arise, come down, and go with them, without doubting anything; for I have sent them. »
Peter went down to the men, and said, "Behold, I am the one you seek. Why did you come? »
They answered, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, and of whom the whole nation of the Jews speaks well, has been commissioned by a holy angel to invite you to his house and to hear what you say."
So he sent for them and provided them with lodging. The next day Peter got up and went out with them, and some of Joppa's brothers accompanied him.
The next day, they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having summoned his relatives and close friends.
When Peter entered, Cornelius came to meet him, threw himself at his feet and adored him.
But Peter raised him up, saying, "Arise! I too am a man. »
As he was talking with him, he went in and found many people assembled.
He said to them, "You yourselves know that it is forbidden for a man of the Jewish race to unite or to approach a man of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man ungodly or unclean.
That's why I also came without complaining when I was sent for . I therefore ask you why you have sent for me. »
Cornelius says: "Four days ago I fasted until this hour; At the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me, dressed in a bright garment
and saying, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and God remembers your gifts to the needy.'
Send therefore to Joppa and send for Simon, who is also called Peter. He lodged in the house of a currier named Simon, by the sea. When he arrives, he will talk to you.
So I sent you immediately, and you did well to come. Now, therefore, we are all here before God to hear all that God has commanded you. »
Peter opened his mouth and said, "Verily, I know that God does not show favoritism,
but let him accept in all nations him who fears him and practices justice.
The word which he sent to the children of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all,
you yourselves know what happened, and which was proclaimed in all Judea, beginning with Galilee, after the baptism which John preached,
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, who went from place to place doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
We are witnesses of all that he did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, where they also killed him, hanging him on the tree.
God raised him up on the third day and made him known,
not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen beforehand by God, to us who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead.
He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that it is he who has been appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead.
All the prophets testify of him that, by his name, whoever believes in him receives forgiveness of sins. »
While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who listened to the word.
Those of the circumcised who had believed were amazed, all those who had come with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.
For they heard them speak in other tongues and magnify God. Peter answered:
"Can anyone forbid these people to be baptized with water? They received the Holy Spirit, just like us. »
He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay a few days.
The apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
When Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision disputed him,
saying, "You went to the uncircumcised and ate with them."
Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying:
"I was in the city of Joppa, praying, and I had a vision: a vessel that came down, like a great canvas stretched from heaven from four corners. He came to me.
After looking at it carefully, I considered and saw the quadrupeds of the earth, the wild animals, the reptiles and the birds of the air.
I also heard a voice saying to me: "Arise, Peter, kill and eat!"
But I said, "No, Lord, for nothing filthy or unclean has ever entered my mouth."
But for the second time, a voice answered me from heaven: "What God has purified, do not call it unclean.
This happened three times, and all ascended to heaven.
Immediately three men presented themselves before the house where I was, sent from Caesarea to me.
The Spirit tells me to go with them without distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the house of this man.
He told us that he had seen the angel stand in his house and say to him, "Send to Joppa to fetch Simon, surnamed Peter,
who will speak to you the words by which you and all your household will be saved."
As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us in the beginning.
And I remembered the word of the Lord, who said: "John baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit."
If, then, God gave them the same gift as it did to us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, to resist God? »
When they heard these things, they were silent and glorified God, saying, "Then God also granted the Gentiles repentance to life!"
Those who had been scattered by the oppression which had arisen over Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking to no one, except to the Jews only.
But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, came to Antioch and addressed the Hellenes, preaching to the Lord Jesus.
The hand of the Lord was with them, and many believed and turned to the Lord.
The rumour about them reached the ears of the assembly in Jerusalem. They sent Barnabas as far as Antioch,
who, after arriving and seeing the grace of God, rejoices. He exhorted them all to cleave with all their hearts to the Lord.
For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and many people were added to the Lord.
Barnabas set out for Tarsus, in search of Saul.
Having found him, he took him to Antioch. For a whole year they were gathered together with the congregation, and they taught many people. It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
In those days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
One of them, named Agabus, arose and announced by the Spirit that there must be a great famine in the whole world, which also happened in the time of Claudius.
All the disciples, who were in abundance, resolved to send help to the brethren who dwelt in Judea.
which they also did, sending them to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
About this time King Herod stretched out his hands to oppress a part of the assembly.
He put to death by the sword James, the brother of John.
Seeing that this pleased the Jews, he also seized Peter. It was during the days of unleavened bread.
After arresting him, he put him in prison and handed him over to four squads of four soldiers each, to guard him, with the intention of bringing him out before the people after the Passover.
Peter was therefore kept in the prison, but the assembly did not cease to pray to God for him.
On the very night that Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound by two chains. Guards outside the door guarded the prison.
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, "Get up quickly!" His chains fell from his hands.
The angel said to him, "Dress yourself and put on your sandals." He did so. Then he said to him, "Put on your cloak and follow me."
And he went out and followed him. He didn't know that what the angel was doing was real, but he believed he had a vision.
When they had passed the first and second guards, they arrived at the iron gate which leads to the city, and which opened by itself. They went out and went down a street, and immediately the angel withdrew from him.
When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent his angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people expected."
Thinking of this, he went to the house of Mary, mother of John, surnamed Mark, where many people were gathered and praying.
When Peter knocked at the door of the house, a servant, named Rhoda, came to answer him.
When she recognized Peter's voice, she did not open the door with joy, but ran to report that Peter was standing before the door.
They said to him, "You are mad!" But she insisted that it should be so. They said, "He is his angel."
But Pierre continued to strike. When they opened it, they saw it and were amazed.
But he, beckoning them with his hand to be silent, told them how the Lord had brought him out of prison. He said, "Say these things to James and the brethren." Then he went and went to another place.
As soon as it was daylight, there was a great commotion among the soldiers to find out what had become of Peter.
Herod, having sought him and not finding him, questioned the guards, and then ordered them to be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.
Now Herod was very angry with the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon. They came to him with one accord and, having made Blastus the king's personal helper, their friend, they sued for peace, for their country depended on the king's country for its food.
On a appointed day, Herod dressed himself in his royal garments, sat down on the throne, and addressed them in a speech.
The people cried out, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!"
Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, for he did not give glory to God. Then he was devoured by worms and died.
But the word of God grew and multiplied.
Barnabas and Saul, after having performed their service, returned to Jerusalem, taking with them also John, called Mark.
Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, the adopted brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them."
Then, after fasting and praying, and laying hands on them, they sent them away.
So, after being sent by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they embarked for the island of Cyprus.
When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as their assistant.
After crossing the island to Paphos, they found a sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar Jesus,
who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.
But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name is called according to the interpretation) put up a resistance to them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, fixed his eyes on him
and said, "Son of the devil, full of every kind of deceit and cunning, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
Now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, you will not see the sun for a while! » . Immediately, a fog and darkness descended on him. He walked to and fro, looking for someone to lead him by the hand.
Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
Paul and his troop set out from Paphos and arrived at Perga, in Pamphylia. John separated from them and returned to Jerusalem.
They, leaving Perga, went to Antioch from Pisidia. They entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and sat down.
After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them to say, "Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to the people, speak."
Paul stood up, and gesturing with his hand, he said, "Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.
The God of this people chose our fathers, exalted the people when they sojourned as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with his arm raised he brought them out of that land.
For a period of about forty years, he endured them in the wilderness.
When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years.
After this, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
After deposing him, he raised up David for them as king, to whom he bore this testimony: "I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will do all my will.
It was from this man's seed that God brought salvation to Israel, in accordance with his promise,
before his coming, when John had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel.
As John was doing his task, he said, "What do you suppose I am? I am not him. But behold, someone is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals from his feet."
"Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those of you who fear God, the word of salvation is addressed to you.
For the inhabitants of Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not know him, nor the voices of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
Although they found no cause of death, they still asked Pilate to put him to death.
When they had fulfilled all that was written about him, they took him down from the wood and laid him in a tomb.
But God raised him from the dead,
and he was seen for many days by those who had gone up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and who are his witnesses to the people.
We preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers,
"Concerning the fact that he raised him from the dead, that he might not return to corruption again, he spoke thus: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
That is why he also says in another psalm: "You shall not allow your Holy One to see corruption.
For David, after having, in his generation, served the counsel of God, fell asleep, lay down with his fathers, and saw decay.
But he whom God raised up did not see decadence.
Know, therefore, brethren, that through this man the remission of sins is proclaimed to you;
and that by him whoever believes is justified from all things of which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
Take heed, therefore, that what is spoken by the prophets does not come upon you:
"See, mockers! To marvel and perish, for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe at all, if you are told it. »
When the Jews came out of the synagogue, the Gentiles asked that these words be announced to them on the following Sabbath.
At the end of the synagogue, many of the Jews and pious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, exhorted them to persevere in the grace of God.
On the next Sabbath, almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
But the Jews, seeing the crowd, were filled with jealousy, contradicted Paul's words, and blasphemed.
Paul and Barnabas boldly spoke up and said, "The word of God must first be preached to you. Since you have rejected it of yourselves, and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
For thus the Lord commanded us, saying, I have made thee light unto the Gentiles, that thou mayest bring salvation to the ends of the earth. »
The Gentiles, having heard this, rejoiced and glorified the word of God. All those who were destined for eternal life believed.
The word of the Lord spread throughout the region.
But the Jews, stirring up the pious women and notables, as well as the leading men of the city, stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territory.
But they shook the dust from their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
The disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
At Icon, they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and they spoke in such a way that a great multitude of Jews and Greeks believed.
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brethren.
They remained there a long time, speaking boldly to the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting that signs and wonders should be done by their hands.
But the crowd of the city was divided. One part sided with the Jews and the other with the apostles.
Some of the pagans and Jews, with their leaders, seeking to ill-treat and stone them,
They preached the Good News there.
At Lystra, a man was sitting, impotent in his feet, crippled from his mother's womb, and who had never walked.
He listened to Paul speak, who, fixing his eyes on him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
said in a loud voice, "Stand up on your feet!" He jumped up and walked.
The crowd, seeing what Paul had done, raised their voices, and said in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in the form of men."
They called Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paul "Mercury," because he was the chief orator.
The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was opposite their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and he would have offered a sacrifice with the crowd.
But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, when they heard this, tore their garments and threw themselves into the crowd, crying:
"Men, why do you do this? We also are men of the same nature as you, and we bring you good news, that you may turn from these vain things to the living God, who made heaven, earth, sea, and all that is in them;
who, in past generations, has let all nations go their own ways.
Yet he did not leave himself without a witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and joy. »
Even in saying these things, they hardly prevented the crowd from offering them a sacrifice.
But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium, having arrived there, persuaded the crowd to stone Paul and drag him out of the city, believing that he was dead.
But as the disciples were standing around him, he arose, and entered the city. The next day, he left with Barnabas for Derbe.
After preaching the good news in that city and making many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconus, and Antioch,
strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to persevere in the faith, and telling them that it is through many afflictions that they must enter the kingdom of God.
After appointing elders for them in every assembly, and after praying and fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
They crossed Pisidia and arrived in Pamphylia.
After proclaiming the word to Perga, they went down to Attalia.
From there they sailed for Antioch, whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had done.
When they came and gathered the congregation, they told all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.
They stayed there for a long time with the disciples.
Some men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
Paul and Barnabas did not fail to argue with them, and they commissioned Paul, Barnabas, and some others of them to go up to Jerusalem to consult the apostles and elders on this matter.
After being sent by the assembly, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, announcing the conversion of the pagans. They caused great joy to all the brethren.
When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly, the apostles and the elders, and they related all that God had done with them.
But some of the sect of the believing Pharisees arose, saying, "They must be circumcised and commanded to observe the law of Moses."
The apostles and elders met to deliberate on this matter.
After much discussion, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brethren, you know that God made a choice among you long ago, so that through my mouth the nations might hear the word of the Good News and believe.
God, who knows hearts, has borne witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, as he has done for us.
He made no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
Now, then, why do you tempt God, by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we could bear?
But we believe that we are saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, just like them. »
The whole crowd was silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul relate the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the nations.
After they had been silent, James spoke up and said, "Brethren, listen to me.
Simeon reported how God first visited the nations to bring out a people for his name.
This is in accordance with the words of the prophets. As it is written,
"After that, I will come back. I will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen. I will rebuild its ruins. I'm going to erect it
that the rest of men may seek the Lord: all the Gentiles who are called by my name, saith the Lord, who does all these things."
"All the works of God are known to him from all eternity.
Therefore I am of opinion that we do not bother those of the Gentiles who are converted to God,
but that we write to them to abstain from the pollution of idols, sexual immorality, what is strangled and blood.
For Moses, from generation to generation, has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath. »
Then it seemed good to the apostles and elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men from among them, and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, leaders of the brethren.
They wrote these things with their own handwriting: "The apostles, the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are of the heathen, in Antioch, in Syria, and in Cilicia: greetings.
We have heard that some of those who have gone out of us have troubled you with words, and have troubled your souls, saying, "You must be circumcised and keep the law, although we have given no commandment;
it seemed good to us, after having come to an agreement, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
men who risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
So we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.
For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay no other burden on you than these necessary things:
let you abstain from meat sacrificed to idols, blood, strangled animals, and immorality, things of which you will be very careful. Farewell. »
Thus, after being sent, they arrived at Antioch. Having gathered the crowd, they handed over the letter.
After reading it, they rejoiced at this encouragement.
Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them.
After spending some time in these places, the brethren sent them back in peace to the apostles.
Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others.
A few days later, Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us now return to visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, to see how they are."
Barnabas intended to take with them also John, who was called Mark.
But Paul did not think it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and who had not gone with them to do the work.
Then the dispute became so sharp that they parted from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed for the island of Cyprus,
but Paul chose Silas and departed, recommended by the brethren to the grace of God.
He traveled through Syria and Cilicia, fortifying the assemblies.
He arrived at Derbe and Lystra. And behold, there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but whose father was a Greek.
The brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium bore good testimony of him.
Paul wanted to take him with him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those countries. for all knew that his father was a Greek.
As they passed through the cities, they gave them the decrees to be observed, which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
The assemblies were thus strengthened in the faith, and their number increased every day.
When they had passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, the Holy Spirit forbade them to proclaim the word in Asia.
When they arrived in front of Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia, but the Spirit would not allow them.
Passing through Mysia, they descended to Troas.
A vision appeared to Paul during the night. There was a man from Macedonia there, who begged him, saying, "Go over to Macedonia and help us."
After having seen this vision, we immediately sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to proclaim the Good News to them.
Leaving Troas, therefore, we made a direct course for Samothrace, and the next day for Neapolis,
and thence to Philippi, a city of Macedonia, the most important in the district, a Roman colony. We stayed a few days in this city.
On the Sabbath day, we went out of the city, to the bank of a river, where we thought there was a place of prayer, and we sat down to talk to the women who had gathered.
A woman named Lydia, a purple seller, from the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, listened to us. The Lord opened her heart to listen to what Paul was saying.
When she was baptized with her family, she pleaded with us, saying, "If you have judged me faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay there." So she persuaded us.
As we were going to pray, we met a young girl gifted with a spirit of divination, who brought a great deal to her masters by telling them fortunes.
Following Paul and us, she cried out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us a way of salvation!"
She acted like this for several days. But Paul, very angry, turns around and says to the spirit, "I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her." He went out at the same hour.
But seeing that the hope of gain had disappeared, his masters seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the public square before the magistrates.
Having brought them before the magistrates, they said: "These men, who are Jews, are agitating our city
and advocate customs which we are not permitted to accept or observe, being Romans. »
The crowd rose up against them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes, and then ordered them to be beaten with rods.
After having subjected them to many blows with rods, they threw them into prison, instructing the jailer to keep them safe.
Having received this order, he threw them into the inner prison and fixed their feet in the vines.
Around midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang hymns to God, and the prisoners listened to them.
Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; at that very moment, all the doors were opened, and the bonds of each were broken.
The jailer, awakened by sleep and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.
But Paul cried out in a loud voice, "Do not hurt yourself, for we are all here."
He asked for lights, entered, threw himself trembling before Paul and Silas,
He sent them out, and said, "Gentlemen, what must I do to be saved?"
They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your family will be saved."
They preached the word of the Lord to him, and to all those who were in his house.
He took them at the very hour of the night, washed their wounds, and was immediately baptized, he and all his family.
He brought them up to his house, served them food, and rejoiced greatly with all his family, because they had believed in God.
But when the day came, the magistrates sent the sergeants to say, "Let these men go."
The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to release you; go out and go in peace. »
But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly without trial, Romans, and have thrown us into prison. Will they now secretly release us? No, most certainly, but let them come themselves and take us out! » .
The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, who were frightened to learn that they were Romans.
and they came to beg them. When they had brought them out, they begged them to leave the city.
They left the prison and entered the house of Lydia. After seeing the brothers, they encouraged them, and then they left.
After passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they arrived at Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
Paul, according to his custom, went into their house; and for three sabbaths he conversed with them according to the Scriptures,
explaining and demonstrating that Christ was to suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ."
Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas; among the pious Greeks, a great crowd, and several trusted women.
But the Jews, who were not convinced, took with them some wicked men from the place and, gathering a crowd, stirred up the city. Assailing Jason's house, they sought to bring them out before the people.
When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the chiefs of the city, crying out, "Those who have turned the world upside down have also come hither,
and Jason received them. All these act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, by saying that there is another king, Jesus! »
The crowd and the leaders of the city were troubled when they heard these things.
After taking the guarantee of Jason and the others, they let them go.
The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas by night to Beroe. When they arrived, they entered the Jewish synagogue.
Now these people were nobler than those of Thessalonica, in that they received the word with complete availability of mind, examining the Scriptures every day to see if these things were true.
Many of them therefore believed, as well as eminent Greek women, and many men.
But when the Jews of Thessalonica heard that the word of God had been spoken by Paul in Beroe also, they also came, stirring up the crowd.
Then the brothers immediately sent Paul to the sea, while Silas and Timothy remained there.
But those who escorted Paul took him as far as Athens. Having received orders from Silas and Timothy to come to him very quickly, they departed.
While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was inflamed within him, when he saw the city full of idols.
So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the pious people, and every day in the public square with those who met him.
Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. Some said: "What does this talkative man mean?" Others said, "He seems to be advocating foreign deities," because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
They seized him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "Can we know what this new doctrine of which you speak is?
For you make our ears hear strange things. So we want to know what these things mean. »
Now all the Athenians and foreigners who lived there spent their time only in telling or hearing something new.
Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every respect.
In fact, in passing and observing the objects of your worship, I found an altar bearing this inscription: "TO AN UNKNOWN GOD"; I therefore announce to you what you worship out of ignorance.
The God who made the world and all that is in it, who is the Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands.
He is not served by the hands of men, as if he needed something, since he himself gives life, breath and all things to all.
He created all the nations of men with one blood to dwell on the whole face of the earth, fixing the seasons and the limits of their dwellings,
so that they might seek the Lord, if perhaps they could reach him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us.
For it is in him that we live, that we move, and that we have our existence. As some of your poets have said: "For we are also his descendants".
Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not think that the divine nature is like gold, silver, or stone, engraved by the art and purpose of man.
So God has neglected the times of ignorance. But now he commands that all men, everywhere, repent,
because he has appointed a day when he will judge the world according to righteousness, by the man whom he has appointed, and whose assurance he has given to all men that he has raised him from the dead. »
When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some laughed; but the others said, "We want to hear from you about this again."
So Paul withdrew from among them.
But some men joined him, and believed, among others Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
He found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had just arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla, for Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them,
and, as he exercised the same trade, he lived with them and worked, for they were tent-makers.
He gave speeches in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul, moved by the Spirit, testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook off his clothes and said to them, "Let your blood be on your heads! I am pure. From now on, I will go to the pagans! »
He left thence and entered the house of a man named Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his household. Many of the Corinthians, after hearing this, believed and were baptized.
The Lord said to Paul at night in a vision, "Do not be afraid, but speak and be not silent;
for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you, for I have many people in this city. »
He stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God in their midst.
But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, with one accord, rose up against Paul and brought him before the tribunal.
saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were indeed a matter of evil or crime, you Jews would be reasonable for me to bear with you;
but if it is a question of words and names and of your own law, look for yourselves. Because I don't want to be the judge of these questions. »
He therefore expelled them from the tribunal.
Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and defeated him before the tribunal. Gallio didn't care about any of these things.
Paul, having stayed several days after this, took leave of the brethren, and embarked from there for Syria, with Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head at Cenchrea, for he had made a vow.
He arrived at Ephesus, where he left them, but he himself entered the synagogue and conversed with the Jews.
When they asked him to stay longer with them, he refused;
but, taking leave of them, he said, "I must absolutely celebrate the feast that is coming to Jerusalem, but I will return to you if God wills." Then he set out from Ephesus.
After landing at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and then he went down to Antioch.
After spending some time there, he set out and passed through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, to settle all the disciples.
Now a Jew named Apollos, of Alexandrian race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was versed in the Scriptures.
This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and, fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught with accuracy the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.
He began to speak confidently in the synagogue. But Priscilla and Aquila, having heard him, took him aside and explained to him more accurately the way of God.
When he had decided to go over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and they wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed by grace;
for he strongly refuted the Jews, publicly demonstrating by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the high country, arrived at Ephesus, where he found some disciples.
He said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They told him, "No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
He said, "What have you been baptized into?" They said, "At the baptism of John."
Paul says, "For John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in him who would come after him, that is, in Christ Jesus."
After hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in other tongues and prophesied.
There were about twelve men in all.
He entered the synagogue, and for three months he spoke boldly, reasoning, and persuading about things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
But, as some were hardened and disobedient, speaking ill of the Way before the crowd, he separated himself from them and separated the disciples, reasoning every day in the school of Tyrannus.
This lasted for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
God worked special miracles through Paul's hands,
so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and diseases withdrew from them, and evil spirits went out.
But some itinerant Jews, exorcists, undertook to invoke upon those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus that Paul preaches."
There were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish high priest, who did this.
The evil spirit answered, "I know Jesus and I know Paul, but who are you?"
The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped upon them, subdued them, and prevailed over them, so that they fled from that house, naked and wounded.
This was known to all the inhabitants of Ephesus, Jews and Greeks. Fear took hold of them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was glorified.
Many of those who had believed also came, confessing and declaring their works.
Many of those who practiced the magical arts gathered together their books and burned them in the eyes of all. They counted the price, which amounted to fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Thus, the word of the Lord spread and became powerful.
Now after these things had come to an end, Paul resolved by the Spirit, after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
Having sent two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself remained for some time in Asia.
About this time there was a great commotion about the way.
In fact, a man named Demetrius, a goldsmith who made silver statues of Artemis, brought a small business to the craftsmen,
which he gathered together with the workers of the same profession, and said: "Gentlemen, you know that it is by this trade that we are rich.
You see and hear that it was not only in Ephesus, but in almost all Asia, that this Paul persuaded and turned away many people, by saying that gods made with hands are not gods.
Not only is our trade in danger of being discredited, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis, whom all Asia and the whole world venerate, is in danger of being counted for nothing and its majesty destroyed. »
When they heard this, they were filled with anger and cried out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
The whole city was filled with confusion, and they all rushed together into the theatre, having taken Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's travelling companions.
When Paul wanted to enter among the people, the disciples would not allow him.
Some of the Asiarci, who were his friends, sent him a letter begging him not to venture on the stage.
Some therefore cried out one thing, others another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn't know why they had come together.
Alexander was brought out of the midst of the crowd, the Jews having brought him forward. Alexander waved to them with his hand, and he would have liked to speak before the people.
But when they saw that he was a Jew, they all cried out with one voice and for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
When the secretary of the city had calmed the crowd, he said, "Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple of the great goddess Artemis and the fallen image of Zeus?
Since you cannot deny these things, stay quiet and do not do anything rash.
For you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.
If, therefore, Demetrius and the artisans who are with him have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them file a complaint against each other.
But if you are looking for something about other business, it will be settled in the regular assembly.
Indeed, we risk being accused about today's riot, without there being any reason. On this subject, we could not give an account of this agitation. »
After the tumult had ceased, Paul summoned the disciples, took leave of them, and set out for Macedonia.
After having traversed these countries and encouraged them with many words, he arrived in Greece.
As he had spent three months there, and a plot had been formed against him by Jews, at the moment when he was embarking for Syria, he resolved to return by way of Macedonia.
These accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroe, Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, Gaius of Derbe, Timothy, Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
But the latter had gone ahead, and they were waiting for us at Troas.
We left Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and joined them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.
On the first day of the week, the disciples being assembled to break bread, Paul conversed with them, intending to depart the next day, and he continued his discourse until midnight.
There were many lights in the upper room where we were gathered.
A young man, named Eutychus, was sitting at the window, overwhelmed by a deep sleep. While Paul was still speaking, overwhelmed by his sleep, he fell from the third floor and was carried away dead.
Paul went down, threw himself on him, and, embracing him, said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."
When he had gone upstairs, had broken bread and eaten, and had conversed with them for a long time, until daybreak, he went away.
They brought the child back alive, and were greatly comforted.
But we went to the boat, and sailed to Assos, intending to take Paul on board, for he had made his arrangements, and intended to come by land.
When he met us at Assos, we took him on board, and arrived at Mitylene.
From there we sailed the next day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stopped at Trogyllium, and the next day we arrived at Miletus.
Paul had indeed decided to pass before Ephesus, in order not to have to stay in Asia, for he was hastening, if he could, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the assembly.
When they came to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day I set foot in Asia, how I have always been with you,
serving the Lord in all humility, with many tears, and in the trials that came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
how I have not been afraid to announce to you all that was useful, teaching you publicly and from house to house,
testifying to the Jews and Greeks repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus.
Now behold, I am going to Jerusalem bound by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,
except that the Holy Spirit bears witness in every city that bonds and tribulations await me.
But these things do not count, and I do not value my life, in order to gladly complete my course and the ministry I have received from the Lord Jesus, to bear full witness to the Good News of God's grace.
"Now, behold, I know that all of you, in the midst of whom I went preaching the kingdom of God, you will no longer see my face.
Therefore I testify to you today that I am cleansed from the blood of all men,
for I have not feared to explain to you all the counsel of God.
Take heed, therefore, to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God, which he has purchased for himself by his own blood.
For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter among you, without sparing the flock.
Men will arise from among you who will say evil things, to drag the disciples after them.
Watch then, remembering that for three years I have not ceased to exhort everyone night and day with tears.
Now, brethren, I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to edify you and give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
I have coveted neither silver, nor gold, nor anyone's clothes.
You yourselves know that these hands have served my needs, and those who were with me.
In all things I have set an example for you, that in your work you may succor the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, who Himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
When he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
They all wept profusely, and, throwing themselves on Paul's neck, they kissed him,
saddened above all by the word he had spoken, that they would no longer see his face. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
After leaving them and setting sail, we headed straight for Cos, then the next day for Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
Having found a ship that was making the crossing to Phoenicia, we went up there and sailed.
After sighting the island of Cyprus, which we left on our left, we sailed for Syria, and landed at Tyre, for the ship was there to unload her cargo.
Having found disciples, we stayed there seven days. They told Paul, by the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
When these days were over, we set out and set out. All of them, with wives and children, accompanied us until we had left the city. Kneeling on the beach, we prayed.
After saying goodbye, we boarded the ship, and they returned home.
When we had finished the journey from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers and stayed with them one day.
The next day, we who were Paul's companions set out and arrived at Caesarea. We entered the house of Philip the Evangelist, who was one of the seven, and we remained with him.
Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
As we had been there for a few days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
Coming to us and taking Paul's girdle, he bound his hands and feet, and said, "The Holy Spirit said, The Jews of Jerusalem will bind the man to whom this girdle belongs, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."
When we heard these things, we begged him and the inhabitants of that place not to go up to Jerusalem.
Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. »
Since he would not be convinced, we stopped saying, "The will of the Lord be done."
After these days, we packed our bags and went up to Jerusalem.
Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us, as well as a certain Mnason, from Cyprus, a disciple of the first hour, with whom we were to lodge.
When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us with joy.
The next day, Paul went with us to James' house, and all the elders were present.
After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had wrought among the pagans through his ministry.
These, after hearing him, glorified God. They said to him, "You see, brother, that there are thousands of believers among the Jews, and all are zealous for the law.
It has been learned about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to renounce Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children and not to follow the customs.
What to do then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.
Do as we tell you. We have four men who have made a wish.
Take them and purify yourself with them, and pay for them their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things they have been told about you, but that you too walk in keeping the law.
But as for the pagans who believed, we have written our decision that they must observe nothing of the kind, except that they must beware of food offered to idols, blood, strangled objects, and fornication. »
Then Paul took the men, purified himself the next day, and entered with them into the temple, announcing the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering had been presented for each of them.
When the seven days were nearly over, the Jews of Asia, seeing him in the temple, lifted up the whole crowd and laid their hands on him.
crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, against the law, and against this place. In addition, he brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place! »
For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
The whole city was moved and the people came running. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were closed.
As they sought to kill him, the news reached the commander of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in turmoil.
Immediately he took soldiers and centurions and ran to them. The latter, seeing the tribune and the soldiers, ceased to beat Paul.
Then the tribune approached, stopped him, ordered him to be bound with two chains, and asked who he was and what he had done.
Some shouted one thing and others another, among the crowd. As he could not know the truth because of the noise, he ordered that he be taken to the barracks.
When he arrived at the staircase, he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd;
for the multitude of the people followed him, crying, "Let him go!"
As Paul was about to be taken to the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, "May I speak to you?" He said, "Do you know Greek?
Are you not the Egyptian who, before these days, stirred up to sedition and led the four thousand men of the assassins into the desert?
But Paul said, "I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of a city that is not insignificant. Please allow me to speak to the people. »
After giving him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned to the people. As there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
"Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense I now make to you."
When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more silent. He said:
"I am truly a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict tradition of the law of our fathers, zealous for God, as you all are today.
I persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering men and women to prison,
as the high priest and all the council of elders testify, from whom I also received letters for the brethren, and I went to Damascus to bring to Jerusalem those who were there, bound to be punished.
"As I was on my way and approaching Damascus, about noon, a great light suddenly burst forth from the sky around me.
I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
I answered, "Who are you, Lord?" He said to me, "I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.
Those who were with me saw the light and were afraid, but they did not understand the voice of the one who spoke to me.
I said, "What shall I do, Lord?" The Lord answered me, 'Get up and go to Damascus. There you will be informed of all that is prescribed to you.
As I could not see because of the glory of this light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I entered Damascus.
A certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law, well known to all the Jews who inhabited Damascus,
came to me, and, standing by me, he said to me, "Brother Saul, receive your sight. At the same hour, I raised my eyes to him.
He said, "The God of our fathers has ordained you to know his will, to see the righteous one, and to hear the voice of his mouth.
For you will be a witness to him before all men of what you have seen and heard.
Now, why are you waiting? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord'.
"When I returned to Jerusalem and prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance
and I saw him saying to me, "Make haste to come out of Jerusalem, for they do not want to receive from you the testimony that concerns me.
I replied, "Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in all the synagogues those who believed in you.
And when the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I too was there, consenting to his death and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.
"He said to me, 'Go away, for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.'"
They listened to him until he said this, and then they raised their voices and said, "Get rid of this man's earth, for he is not worthy to live."
As they screamed, threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,
the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and to be examined by scourging, in order to know for what crime they were thus crying out against him.
When they had tied him with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who was standing there, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and has not been found guilty?"
The centurion, when he heard this, went to the commander and said to him, "Be careful what you are going to do, for this man is a Roman."
The commander came and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" He said, "Yes."
The commander replied, "I bought my citizenship at a great price." Paul said, "But I was born a Roman."
Immediately those who were about to interrogate him withdrew from him, and the tribune was also frightened when he perceived that he was a Roman, for he had caused him to be bound.
But the next day, desiring to know the truth as to why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from bonds, and ordered the chief priests and the whole council to assemble, to bring Paul down, and to bring him before them.
Paul, looking fixedly at the counsel, said, "Brethren, I have lived before God in good conscience to this day."
The high priest, Ananias, ordered those who stood near him to slap him on the mouth.
Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, whitewashed wall! Do you sit down to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?
Those who stood there said, "Are you defaming the high priest of God?"
Paul said, "I did not know, brethren, that he was high priest. For it is written: "You shall not speak ill of a ruler of your people."
But Paul, seeing that some were Sadducees and others Pharisees, cried out in the Sanhedrin, "Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees. It is on the hope and resurrection of the dead that I am judged! »
As soon as he had said this, a dispute arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the crowd was divided.
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, no angel, no spirit; but the Pharisees confess all this.
A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes, on the side of the Pharisees, arose and disputed, saying, "We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God! »
A great dispute having arisen, the commander, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to come down, take him by force among them, and bring him to the barracks.
The next night the Lord stood by him and said, "Be of good cheer, Paul, for as you bore witness of me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness to Rome."
When it was day, some of the Jews gathered together and bound themselves by a curse, saying that they would not eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
There were more than forty persons who had formed this conspiracy.
They went to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves with a great curse that we will not taste anything until we have killed Paul."
Now, therefore, you, with the council, inform the tribune that he is to bring him to you tomorrow, as if you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he gets closer. »
The son of Paul's sister, having heard that they were on the lookout, entered the barracks and informed Paul.
Paul sent for one of the centurions and said, "Bring this young man to the commander, for he has something to say to him."
So he took him and brought him to the commandant, saying, "Paul, the prisoner, has summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you. »
The commander took him by the hand and, going away, asked him privately: "What have you to say to me?"
He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul to the council tomorrow, as if they intended to inquire a little more about him.
Do not yield to them, for more than forty men are waiting for him, who have bound themselves by a curse not to eat or drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you. »
So the commander let the young man go, recommending him, "Don't tell anyone that you have revealed these things to me."
He called two of the centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."
He asked them to provide mounts, in order to get Paul on one of them and bring him safe and sound to Felix, the governor.
He wrote a letter in the following terms:
"Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
This man had been seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, when I arrived with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
Wishing to know why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.
I found that he was accused on matters pertaining to their law, but that he was not accused of anything that deserved death or imprisonment.
When I was told that the Jews were waiting for this man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers to present to you their accusations against him as well. Farewell. »
The soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and conducted him by night to Antipatris.
The next day, they left the horsemen who were to accompany him and returned to the barracks.
When they arrived at Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
After reading it, the governor asked what province he came from. When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said:
"I will hear you fully when your accusers have also arrived." He ordered him to be kept in Herod's palace.
Five days after, the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an orator, a certain Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul.
When he was summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Since through you we enjoy great peace, and through your foresight prosperity comes to this nation,
But, in order not to delay you, I beg you to put up with us and listen to a few words.
For we have found this man to be a scourge, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews of the whole world, and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
He even tried to desecrate the temple, and we arrested him.
By examining him yourself, you will be able to ascertain all these things of which we accuse him. »
The Jews also joined the attack, claiming that these things were true.
When the governor beckoned him to speak, Paul spoke up and said, "Since I know that you have long been a judge of this nation, I willingly accept to defend myself.
since you can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
I was not found in the temple arguing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, neither in the synagogues nor in the city.
Nor can they prove to you the things they are now accusing me of.
But I confess to you that, according to the way which they call a sect, I serve the God of our fathers, believing in all that is according to the law and that which is written in the prophets,
hoping in God, which they themselves hope, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.
This is what I also practice, always having a conscience free from offense to God and to men.
Now, after a few years, I have come to bring to my nation gifts for the needy and offerings;
in the midst of which some Jews of Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor with tumult.
They should have come here before you and filed a complaint, if they had anything against me.
Or let these men themselves say what injustice they found in me when I appeared before the council,
unless it was for this reason alone that I cried out in the midst of them, "It is on the resurrection of the dead that I am judged before you today."
But Felix, who had a more precise knowledge of the way, reported them, saying, "When Lysias, the commander, has come down, I will decide your case."
He commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to grant him some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or visit him.
A few days after, Felix, accompanied by Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul and heard him about faith in Jesus Christ.
As he discoursed on justice, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified and replied, "Go away for the present, and when it suits me, I will summon you."
In the meantime, he also hoped that Paul would give him money, in order to free him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.
Two years later, Porcius Festus succeeded Felix. Eager to curry favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in prison.
Festus, having arrived in the province, went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem at the end of three days.
Then the high priest and the leading men of the Jews gave him information against Paul, and they begged him,
asking him for a favor, to summon him to Jerusalem, plotting to kill him on the way.
But Festus replied that Paul was to be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself would soon depart.
"Let those who have power among you," he said, "come down with me, and if there is anything evil in this man, let them accuse him."
After spending more than ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat down on the tribunal, and ordered Paul to be brought in.
When he was brought in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many and grave accusations which they could not prove.
while he said in his defence, "I have committed no sin, neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar."
But Festus, desirous of gaining the favor of the Jews, spoke up and said to Paul, "Will you go up to Jerusalem and be judged by me about these things?"
But Paul answered, "I stand before the tribunal of Caesar, where I am to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.
For if I have committed a fault and something that deserves death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of these things of which they accuse me is true, no one can deliver me up to them. I appeal to Caesar! »
Then Festus, after consulting the council, spoke up and said, "You have appealed to Caesar. It is to Caesar that you will go. »
A few days later, King Agrippa and Berenice arrived in Caesarea and greeted Festus.
When he remained there several days, Festus explained to the king the cause of Paul, saying, "There is a man whom Felix has left prisoner,
and concerning which, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him.
I told them that it is not the custom of the Romans to deliver a man to death before the accused has met his accusers and had an opportunity to defend himself on the charges against him.
So when they gathered here, I didn't delay, but the next day, I sat on the seat of the court and ordered the man to be brought in.
The accusers, having risen, did not accuse him of the things I had supposed,
but they asked him questions about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, dead, whom Paul declared to be alive.
Not knowing how to inquire about these things, I asked him if he would go to Jerusalem and be judged there on this subject.
But when Paul asked that he be kept for the emperor's judgment, I ordered him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar. »
Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear it myself." "To-morrow," he said, "you will hear it."
The next day, Agrippa and Berenice having come with great pomp, and having entered the place of audience with the commanders and principals of the city, by order of Festus, Paul was brought in.
Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all who are here with us, you see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews have made supplications to me, both in Jerusalem and here, saying that he should live no more.
But as I found that he had committed nothing that deserved death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him,
he of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after examination, I may have something to write.
Because it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to specify the charges against him. »
Agrippa said to Paul, "You can speak in your own name." Then Paul stretched out his hand and defended him.
"I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, to have to defend myself before you today on all the things of which I am accused by the Jews,
all the more so since you are an expert in all the customs and in all the questions that arise among the Jews. I therefore beg you to listen to me with patience.
"For all the Jews know my way of life from my youth, which from the beginning was among my own nation and in Jerusalem;
having known me from the beginning, if they will testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee.
Now, I stand here to be judged because of the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,
which our twelve tribes, serving with ardor night and day, hope to reach. It is on this hope that I am accused by the Jews, King Agrippa!
Why do you think it is incredible that God raises the dead?
"I myself have most certainly thought that I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
This is also what I did in Jerusalem. I have caused a great number of saints to be shut up in prisons, having received the authority of the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I voted against them.
Often punishing them in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme. Being extremely furious with them, I persecuted them even in foreign cities.
"While I was going to Damascus with the authorization and mission of the chief priests,
At noon, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, which surrounded me and those who traveled with me.
When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is difficult for you to strike against the goads."
"I said, 'Who are you, Lord? He said, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
But arise and stand on your feet, for for this purpose I have appeared to you, to make you a servant and witness of the things which you have seen and of those which I will reveal to you,
to deliver you from the people and the pagans to whom I send you,
to open their eyes, that they may pass from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive the remission of sins, and an inheritance from those who are sanctified by faith in me.
"Wherefore, King Agrippa, I have not disobeyed the heavenly vision,
but I have announced first to those of Damascus, to Jerusalem, to all the land of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
That is why the Jews seized me in the temple and wanted to put me to death.
Having therefore obtained the help that comes from God, I stand to this day to bear witness to the small and the great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses have announced,
how Christ must suffer and how, through the resurrection of the dead, he will be the first to announce light to this people and to the pagans. »
As he was thus defending him, Festus said in a loud voice, "Paul, you are mad! Your great knowledge drives you crazy! »
But he answered, "I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I boldly speak words of truth and reason.
For the king is aware of these things, and it is to him also that I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him, since it was not done in a corner.
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe. »
Agrippa said to Paul, "With a little persuasion, are you trying to make me a Christian?"
Paul says, "I pray to God, that with little or with much, not only you, but also all who listen to me today, may become as I am, except for these bonds."
The king arose with the governor and Berenice, and those who were seated with them.
When they had retired, they spoke to each other, saying, "This man does nothing that deserves death or imprisonment."
Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been freed if he had not appealed to Caesar."
When it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the army of Augustus.
We embarked on a ship from Adramyttium, which was going to sail to places situated on the coast of Asia, Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, being with us.
The next day, we landed at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his friends to refresh himself.
From there we set sail to leeward of the island of Cyprus, for the winds were contrary.
After crossing the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Myra, a city of Lycia.
There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria on its way to Italy, and he put us on board.
After sailing slowly for several days, and arriving with difficulty in front of Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go any further, we sailed to leeward of Crete, opposite Salmone.
We skirted it with difficulty, and arrived at a place called Havres de plaisance, near the town of Lasea.
As much time had passed and the journey had become dangerous, because the fast had already passed, Paul warned them
and said to them, "Gentlemen, I see that the voyage will be made with considerable damage and loss, not only to the cargo and the ship, but also to our lives."
But the centurion paid more attention to the captain and the owner of the ship than to Paul's words.
As the harbor was not conducive to wintering, most people advised to set sail from there, if they could reach Phoenix and spend the winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking southwest and northwest.
When the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had reached their goal, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore.
But soon a stormy wind beat on the shore, which is called Euroclydon.
The ship being taken and unable to face the wind, we yielded to her and were dragged away.
Running to leeward of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to stow the boat.
After hoisting it, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing to run aground on the sandbanks of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let themselves be carried away.
As we were very tried by the storm, the next day they began to throw objects overboard.
On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle with their own hands.
When, for several days, neither the sun nor the stars had shone upon us, and no small storm pressed upon us, all hope of being saved vanished.
After they had been a long time without eating, Paul stood up in the midst of them and said, "Gentlemen, you should have listened to me, and not left Crete, to have this wound and loss.
Now I urge you to take courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only that of the ship.
For this night stood by me an angel, belonging to the God whom I am and whom I serve,
and who said to me, "Fear not, Paul. You must present yourself before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.
That is why, gentlemen, rejoice! For I believe in God, and it will be as I have been told.
But we have to run aground on an island. »
But the fourteenth night having arrived, as we were tossed about in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors supposed that they were approaching some land.
They sounded and found twenty fathoms. A little later, they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.
Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and wished it would be daylight.
As the sailors were trying to escape from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to drop anchors by the bow,
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "If these do not remain in the ship, you cannot be saved."
Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat and let it fall.
As the day drew near, Paul begged them to take food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you are waiting and fasting, without having taken anything.
Therefore I beg you to take food, for it is for your salvation, for not a hair of your heads will perish. »
When he had said this and taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; then he broke it and began to eat.
Then they all rejoiced, and they also took food.
In all, we were two hundred and seventy-six people on the ship.
When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw the wheat into the sea.
When the day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship there.
Casting the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time as they untied the ropes of the rudder. They hoist the headsail upwind and head for the beach.
But arriving at a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground. The bow struck and remained motionless, but the stern began to break with the violence of the waves.
The advice of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them could save themselves by swimming.
But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, turned them away from their purpose, and ordered those who knew how to swim to throw themselves overboard first to reach the mainland;
and that the others follow, some on planks and others on other objects of the ship. In this way they all escaped to dry land.
When we escaped, they learned that the island was called Malta.
The natives showed us an uncommon kindness, for they lit a fire and received us all, because of the rain that was falling and the cold.
But when Paul had gathered a bundle of twigs and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and clung to his hand.
When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, although he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."
However, he shook the creature in the fire, and was not hurt.
They expected that he would have swollen or fallen dead suddenly, but as they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
Now in the vicinity of this place there was land belonging to the chief of the island, named Publius, who received us and conversed courteously with us for three days.
Publius' father was ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went into his house, prayed, and, after laying his hands on him, healed him.
When this was done, the other sick of the island also came and were healed.
They also paid us many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things we needed.
At the end of three months, we embarked on a ship from Alexandria which had wintered on the island, and whose figurehead was "The Twin Brothers."
We landed at Syracuse, where we stayed three days.
From there we went round and arrived at Rhegium. A day later, a south wind arose, and on the second day we arrived at Puteoli,
where we found brethren, and we were requested to stay with them seven days. We therefore arrived at Rome.
From thence the brethren, having heard of us, came to meet us as far as the market of Appius and the three taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
When we entered Rome, the centurion handed over the prisoners to the chief of the guards, but Paul was allowed to remain alone with the soldier who guarded him.
Three days later, Paul summoned the leaders of the Jews. When they were assembled, he said to them, "I, brethren, though I have done nothing against the people or against the customs of our fathers, have been delivered up as a prisoner of Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
The latter, after examining me, wanted to release me, because there was no cause of death in me.
But as the Jews opposed it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, without having anything to reproach my nation with.
That is why I have asked to see you and to speak with you. For it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound by this chain. »
They said to him, "We have not received any letters from Judea about you, and none of the brethren have come here to report or speak ill of you.
But we want to know what you think about you. For, as far as this sect is concerned, we know that everywhere it is denounced. »
When a day was appointed for him, many people came to him in his lodgings. He gave them explanations, testified to the kingdom of God, and persuaded them about Jesus, according to the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning to night.
Some believed in the things that were said, and others did not.
When they disagreed among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken a single message: "The Holy Spirit rightly spoke to our fathers through the prophet Isaiah,
saying, Go to this people and say to them, when you hear, you will hear, but will not understand in any case. When you see, you will see, but that he will not perceive in any case.
For the heart of this people has become insensitive. Their ears are deaf. They closed their eyes. Lest they see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn again, then I will heal them.
"Know therefore that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and that they will hear."
Paul stayed two whole years in the house he rented and received all who came to him,
preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all boldness and without hindrance.
Paul, servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God,
which he promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,
concerning his Son, born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
declared the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, through the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,
by which we have received grace and the apostolate for the obedience of the faith among all nations, for his name's sake;
among whom you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ;
To all those who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be holy: Grace and peace to you, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the world.
For God is my witness, whom I serve in spirit in the Good News of his Son, how unceasingly I mention you in my prayers,
asking if, in one way or another, the will of God finally allows me to go to you.
For I ardently desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be strengthened;
that is to say, that I may be encouraged in you, each one of us by the faith of the other, yours and mine.
Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, that I have often planned to come to you (and have been prevented from doing so until now), in order to bear fruit among you also, as well as among the rest of the pagans.
I owe a debt to the Greeks and foreigners, to the wise and the foolish.
Thus, as far as it is in me, I am eager to proclaim the Good News to you who are also in Rome.
In fact, I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, for it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.
For in it is revealed the righteousness of God, from faith to faith. As it is written, "The righteous shall live by faith."
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
because what is known to God is revealed in them, for God has revealed it to them.
For the invisible things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and divinity, so that they may be without excuse.
Because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor gave thanks, but they became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
Pretending to be wise, they have gone mad,
and they have exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the image of corruptible man, birds, quadrupeds, and reptiles.
Therefore God has given them up to impurity in the lusts of their hearts, that their bodies might be dishonored in their midst.
They turned God's truth into a lie, and they worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is eternally blessed. Amen.
That is why God has given them over to infamous passions. For their wives have changed the natural function into what is unnatural.
In the same way, men, abandoning the natural function of woman, have become inflamed in their lust for one another, men doing what is unbecoming with men, and receiving in themselves the punishment due to their error.
As they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate spirit, to do what is not proper;
being filled with all iniquity, sexual immorality, wickedness, greed, malice; full of envy, murders, quarrels, deceits, bad habits, slanderers in secret,
backbiters, odious to God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of misfortunes, disobedient to their parents,
without intelligence, violators of covenants, without natural affection, pitiless, without mercy,
who, knowing the decree of God, that those who practice such things deserve death, not only do the same, but also approve of those who practice them.
Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever judges it may be. For in what you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge, you practice the same things.
We know that God's judgment is in accordance with the truth against those who practice such things.
Do you think, O man who judges those who practice such things, and does the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?
Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, long-suffering, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?
But according to your harshness and impenitence, you reserve for yourselves wrath in the day of the wrath, of revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God,
who "will render to each one according to his works".
to those who, by perseverance in good deeds, seek glory, honor, and incorruption, eternal life;
but to those who delight in selfishness and do not obey the truth, but obey injustice, there will be anger, indignation,
oppression and anguish on every soul of man who does evil, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek.
But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
For there is no partiality in God.
For all those who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law. All those who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
For it is not those who listen to the law who are righteous before God, but those who do it who will be justified
( for when the Gentiles who have not the law do by nature the things of the law, those, not having the law, are a law unto themselves,
in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience in bearing witness with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or excusing them)
on the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.
For thou bearest the name of Jew, thou rest on the law, thou glory in God,
you know his will, and you approve of good things, being instructed by the law,
and you have the assurance that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
a corrector of fools, an educator of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and truth.
Are you teaching someone else teaching not? You who preach that man should not steal, do you steal?
You who say that a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You, who have a horror of idols, do you plunder the temples?
You who glory in the law, do you dishonor God by disobeying the law?
For "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles for your sake," as it is written.
For circumcision is useful, if you put the law into practice; but if you transgress the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
If, then, the uncircumcised person observes the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be considered as a circumcision?
Will not those who are physically uncircumcised, but who fulfill the law, judge you, who, with the letter and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law?
For he who is a Jew is not a Jew, nor an outward circumcision in the flesh;
but he who is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, of the mind, not of the letter, whose praise does not come from men, but from God.
What advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?
A lot in every respect! Because, first of all, the revelations of God have been entrusted to them.
For what would happen if some were faithless? Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness?
May it never be so! Yes, that we find God true, but every man a liar. As it is written, "that ye may be justified in your words, and may prevail in judgment."
But if our iniquity praises the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, he who inflicts anger? I speak like men.
May it never be so! For then, how will God judge the world?
For if, through my lie, the truth of God has abounded for his glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?
Why not say (as we are calumniously told, and as some say we say): "Let us do evil, that good may come." Those who say this are rightly condemned.
So what? Are we better than them? No, by no means. For we have already warned the Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin.
As it is written, "There is no righteous; No, not a single one.
There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks God.
They have all turned away. Together, they became unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not even one. »
"Their throat is an open tomb. They used their tongues to deceive. "The poison of the vipers is under their lips. »
"Their mouths are full of curses and bitterness."
"Their feet are quick to shed blood.
Destruction and misery are in their ways.
The path of peace they did not know. »
"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be shut and the whole world may be subject to the judgment of God.
For by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him, since it is by the law that the knowledge of sin comes.
But now, independently of the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, attested by the law and the prophets,
the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, for all and on all who believe. For there is no distinction,
since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
and that they are freely justified by his grace, by the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,
whom God sent as a sin offering by faith in his blood, to manifest his righteousness by the remission of previous sins, in the patience of God,
to manifest his righteousness in the present time, in order to be righteous himself and to justify those who have faith in Jesus.
Where is the boasting? It is excluded. By what law? That of the works? No, but by a law of faith.
We therefore maintain that man is justified by faith, independently of the works of the law.
Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the pagans? Yes, pagans too,
since there is only one God who justifies the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised by faith.
Do we then annul the law by faith? May this never be the case! No, we establish the law.
What then shall we say that Abraham, our ancestor, found according to the flesh?
Indeed, if Abraham was justified by works, he has reason to boast, but not before God.
For what does Scripture say? "Abraham believed in God, and it was imputed to him as righteousness."
Now, for the one who works, the reward is not considered as a grace, but as a due.
But to him who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is imputed to righteousness.
In the same way, David pronounces the blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness without works:
"Blessed are those whose faults are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not burden with sin. »
Is this blessing pronounced only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was imputed to Abraham as righteousness.
How, then, was it imputed to him? When he was circumcised, or when he was uncircumcised? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
He received the sign of circumcision, the seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had in uncircumcision, in order to be the father of all those who believe, in spite of their uncircumcision, so that righteousness may also be imputed to them.
He is the father of circumcision for those who are not only circumcision, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.
Indeed, the promise made to Abraham and his descendants to be heirs of the world was not made by law, but by the righteousness of faith.
For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is null, and the promise is of no effect.
For the law produces anger; Where there is no law, there is no disobedience either.
Therefore it is a question of faith, so that it may be according to grace, so that the promise may be assured to all descendants, not only to those who come from the law, but also to those who come from the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
As it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations." This in the presence of Him in whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and who calls things that are not, as if they were.
Against hope, Abraham believed in hope, that he might be the father of many nations, as it had been said, "Thus shall thy seed be."
Without being weakened in the faith, he did not consider his own body, already worn out, (he was about a hundred years old), and the death of Sarah's womb.
But, looking to the promise of God, he did not stagger through unbelief, but he strengthened himself by faith, giving glory to God,
and being fully assured that what he had promised, he could also fulfill.
This is why it has been rightly credited to him.
However, it has not been written that this was imputed to him because of him alone,
but also because of us, to whom it will be imputed, to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
who was betrayed because of our sins and rose again for our justification.
Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
by which we also have access, by faith, to that grace in which we find ourselves. We rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
Not only that, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance;
and perseverance, a tried character; and the tried character, the hope;
and hope does not disappoint us, because the love of God has been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
For while we were still weak, Christ died at the proper time for the ungodly.
For one will hardly die for a righteous man. Yet, for a good man, someone would even dare to die.
But God shows us his love, in that, when we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
How much more, therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.
For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
Not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
Thus, as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, death passed on to all men, because all have sinned.
For until the law sinned was in the world; but sin is not accused when there is no law.
Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sin was not like Adam's disobedience, which is a foreshadowing of him who was to come.
But the free gift is not like the fault. For if, through the sin of one, the multitude died, how much more did the grace of God and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, abound for the many.
The gift is not as if by one who has sinned; for it was by one that judgment came to condemnation, but it was after many faults that the free gift came to justification.
For if, through the sin of one, death has reigned through one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.
Therefore, as by one fault all men were condemned, so by one act of justice all men were justified to life.
For as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one man many will be made righteous.
The law came so that the offense might be abundant; but where sin has abounded, grace has abounded more,
so that, as sin reigned through death, grace may reign through righteousness unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What shall we say, then? Shall we continue to sin, that grace may abound?
May it never be so! We who have died to sin, how can we still live in it?
Don't you know that all of us who have been baptized into Jesus Christ have been baptized into His death?
Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, so that, as Christ rose from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
For if we have been united to him by the likeness of his death, we will also share in his resurrection;
knowing that our old self was crucified with him, so that the body of sin might disappear, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin.
For he who is dead is free from sin.
Now, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,
knowing that Christ, risen from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer dominates him!
For the death from which he died, he once died for sin; but the life he lives is for God's sake.
Therefore consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Do not therefore let sin reign in your mortal body, that you may obey it in its lusts.
In the same way, do not present your members to sin as instruments of iniquity, but present yourselves to God as living from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
For sin will not have dominion over you, since you are not under the law, but under grace.
What? Are we sinning because we are not under the law but under grace? May it never be so!
Do you not know that when you present yourselves as servants and obey someone, you are the servants of him whom you obey, either from sin to death or from obedience to righteousness?
But thanks be to God that, while you were slaves to sin, you obeyed with all your heart the doctrine to which you were delivered.
Freed from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.
I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh; for, as you have presented your members as enslaved to uncleanness and wickedness over wickedness, so now present your members as enslaved to righteousness for sanctification.
For when you were slaves to sin, you were free from righteousness.
What fruit did you bear at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of these things is death.
But now, being freed from sin and become slaves of God, you have your fruit of sanctification and the result of eternal life.
For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over man as long as he lives?
For the wife who has a husband is bound by law to the husband as long as he lives; but if the husband dies, she is freed from the law of the husband.
If, therefore, during the lifetime of her husband, she attaches herself to another man, she is called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is freed from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, although she is united to another man.
Therefore, my brethren, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might be united to another, to him who rose from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit for God.
For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin, which were manifested by the law, acted in our members to produce fruit at death.
But now we have been relieved of the law, having died to what we were bound by, so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in antiquity of letter.
What shall we say then? Is the law a sin? May it never be! However, I would not have known sin if it were not by the law. For I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said, "Thou shalt not covet."
But sin, finding an opportunity in the commandment, has produced in me all kinds of lusts. For without the law, sin is dead.
I was once alive without the law; but, when the commandment came, sin awoke and I died.
The commandment that was for life, I have found for death;
for sin, finding an opportunity in the commandment, has deceived me, and by it has killed me.
Therefore the law is truly holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good.
Has what is good become death for me? May it never be! But sin, in order that it might manifest itself as sin, produced death in me by that which is good, so that, by the commandment, sin might become a great sin.
For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.
Because I don't understand what I'm doing. For I do not practice what I wish to do; but what I hate, I do.
But if what I do not want, I do, I consent to the law that it is good.
So now it is no longer I who do it, but the sin that dwells in me.
For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, no good dwells. For desire is present in me, but I do not find it doing what is good.
For the good that I desire I do not; but the evil that I do not desire, I practice.
And if I do what I don't want to, it's not me who does it anymore, it's the sin that dwells in me.
I therefore find the law that, while I desire to do good, evil is present.
For I delight in the law of God according to the inner person,
but I see in my members another law, which fights against the law of my spirit and makes me captive to the law of sin which is in my members.
What a wretch I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?
I give thanks to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Thus by thought I serve the law of God, but by the flesh the law of sin.
Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk after the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.
For what the law could not do, since it was weak in the flesh, God did, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,
so that the ordinance of the law may be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For those who live according to the flesh cleave to the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit cleave to the things of the Spirit.
For the thought of the flesh is death, but the thought of the Spirit is life and peace;
for the mind of the flesh is hostile to God, because it is not subject to the law of God, and cannot do so.
Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
Now you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now, if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.
If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.
Now, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Jesus Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwells in you.
Therefore, brethren, we are indebted not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
For if you live according to the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the actions of the body, you will live.
For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.
For you have not received a spirit of enslavement to fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry out, "Abba! Father! »
The Spirit himself testifies by our spirit that we are children of God;
and if we are children, we are also heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, if we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.
For I consider that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed to us.
For creation is looking forward to the children of God being revealed.
For creation was subjected to vanity, not by its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope
that creation itself will also be delivered from the bondage of corruption to enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
For we know that, until now, the whole creation groans and sighs in sorrow.
Not only that, but also we, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.
For we have been saved in hope; but the hope that is seen is not a hope. For who hopes for what he sees?
But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait patiently for it.
In the same way, the Spirit comes to the aid of our weaknesses, because we do not know how to pray properly. But the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groans.
He who searches hearts knows what the Spirit thinks, for he intercedes for the saints according to God.
We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
Those whom he predestined he also called. Those whom he called he also justified. Those whom he justified he also glorified.
What shall we say of these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how could he not also freely give us all things with him?
Who could bring an accusation against God's chosen people? It is God who justifies.
Who is the one who condemns? It is Christ who died, or rather who rose from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, and who intercedes for us.
Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?
As it is written, "For your good, we are killed all day long. We were considered sheep for slaughter. »
No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.
For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
neither haughtiness, nor depth, nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
I speak the truth in Christ. I do not lie, my conscience testifying to me by the Holy Spirit
that I have in my heart a great sadness and an incessant pain.
For I myself would like to be cursed by Christ for the sake of my brethren, my parents according to the flesh
who are Israelites; to whom belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;
whose fathers are, and from whom came Christ according to the flesh, who is above all, God, blessed eternally. Amen.
But it is not as if the word of God has remained without effect. For it is not all Israel that is of Israel.
Nor are they all children, since they are the descendants of Abraham. But "your descendants will be numbered like Isaac's."
That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise who are counted as heirs.
For this is the word of the promise: "In the appointed time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son."
Not only that, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.
For not having yet been born, and having done nothing good or evil, that the purpose of God may subsist according to the election, not of works, but of him who calls,
As it is written, "I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau."
What shall we say, then? Is there injustice before God? May there never be any!
For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
Therefore it is not to him who wills, nor to him who runs, but to God who shows mercy.
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and proclaim my name in all the earth."
So he shows mercy to whom he wills, and hardens whom he wills.
You will then say to me: "Why does he still find fault? For who resists his will? »
But truly, O man, who are you to answer against God? Will the thing formed ask the one who formed it, "Why have you made me so?"
Or does not the potter have a right to the clay, from the same mass, to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?
And if God, desiring to show his wrath and make known his power, has borne with great patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
and that he wished to make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory -
we, whom he also called, not only Jews, but also Gentiles?
As he also says in Hosea, "I will call them 'my people,' they who were not my people; and his "beloved", who was not beloved. »
"In the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people.' they will be called "children of the living God". »
Isaiah cries out about Israel, "If the number of the children of Israel be like the sand of the sea, the remnant will be saved;
for he will finish the work and cut it in righteousness, because the Lord will do a short work on the earth. »
As Isaiah once said, "Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah."
What shall we say, then? That the pagans, who did not seek righteousness, have attained to righteousness, to the righteousness of faith;
but that Israel, which sought a law of justice, did not arrive at the law of justice.
What for? Because they did not seek it by faith, but, so to speak, by the works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling block,
as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling block and a rock of scandal; and none of those who believe in him will be disappointed. »
Brethren, the desire of my heart and the prayer I address to God concern Israel, that it may be saved.
For I testify concerning them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
For, ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to the righteousness of God.
For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for the righteousness of every believer.
For Moses writes of the righteousness of the law: "He who does them will live by them."
But the righteousness of faith says this: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend to heaven?' (i.e., to bring down Christ);
or, "Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to raise Christ from the dead.)
But what does he say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart", that is, the word of faith that we preach:
that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and if you believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
For it is with the heart that one believes, which brings about righteousness, and with the mouth that one confesses, which brings salvation.
For the Scripture says, "He that believeth in him shall not be disappointed."
For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is the Lord of all, and he is rich for all who call on him.
Indeed, "Whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
How, then, shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?
And how will they preach without being sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, which brings happy news of good things!"
But they didn't all listen to the happy news. For Isaiah said, "Lord, who believed our report?"
Thus, faith comes from hearing, and hearing from the word of God.
But, I say, have they not heard? Yes, most certainly, "Their sound has spread throughout the earth, their words to the ends of the world."
But I ask: Didn't Israel know this? First Moses said, "I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is not a nation. I will make you angry with a nation devoid of intelligence. »
Isaiah is very bold and says, "I was found by those who had not sought me. I was revealed to those who had not asked me. »
But about Israel, he says, "All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and rebellious people."
So I ask: Has God rejected his people? May it never be so! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
God did not reject his people, whom he knew in advance. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:
"Lord, they have killed your prophets. They have demolished your altars. I was left alone, and they want my life. »
But how does God respond to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
In the same way, at this time too, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is through works, it is no longer grace, otherwise the work is no longer the work.
What? What Israel seeks, it has not obtained; but the elected have obtained it, and the others have become hardened.
As it is written, "God has given them a spirit of amazement, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, until this day."
David said, "Let their table become a snare, a trap, a stumbling block, and a punishment for them.
Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see. Always keep their backs bent. »
So I ask: Did they stumble to fall? May it never be so! But it was by their fall that salvation came to the pagans, to stir them up to jealousy.
Now, if their fall is the wealth of the world, and their loss the wealth of the heathen, how much more their fullness!
For it is to you who are pagans that I speak. Since, therefore, I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,
if, by any means, I can provoke the jealousy of those who are my flesh, and save some of them.
For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what would their acceptance be, if not life from the dead?
If the first fruit is holy, so is the mass. If the root is holy, so are the branches.
But if some of the branches have been cut off, and if you, who are a wild olive tree, have been grafted into the midst of them, and you share with them in the root and richness of the olive tree,
do not glory in the branches. But if you boast, remember that it is not you who sustain the root, but that it is the root that sustains you.
Then you will say, "The branches have been plucked up, that I may be grafted."
It's true; it is by their unbelief that they have been cut off, and you are standing by your faith. Do not be proud, but fear;
for if God has not spared the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
See, then, the goodness and severity of God. With regard to those who have fallen, severity; but with regard to you, goodness, if you persist in its goodness; if not, you too will be cut off.
They too, if they do not persist in their unbelief, will be grafted, for God is able to graft them again.
For if you have been cut off from the wild olive tree, which is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, onto a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted onto their own olive tree?
For I do not want you, brethren, to be ignorant of this mystery, so that you may not go astray in your own ideas: that a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has entered.
and thus may all Israel be saved. As it is written, "Out of Zion shall come the deliverer, and he shall turn away the ungodliness of Jacob.
This is my covenant with them, when I take away their sins. »
As for the Good News, they are enemies because of you. But as for the election, they are loved because of the fathers.
For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.
For as you once disobeyed God, but now have obtained mercy through your disobedience,
so these also have now disobeyed, so that, by the mercy that has been shown you, they may also obtain mercy.
For God has bound all men to disobedience, that he might show mercy to all.
Oh! the depth of the riches of wisdom and knowledge of God! How unfathomable are his judgments, how his paths cannot be traced!
"For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who was his advisor? »
"Or who gave him first, and that it will be returned to him again?"
For it is from him, through him, and for him that all things come. To him be the glory for ever and ever! Amen.
I exhort you, therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, to offer your body as a living, holy, God-pleasing sacrifice, which is your spiritual service.
Do not conform yourselves to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good, acceptable and perfect.
For I say, by the grace that has been given to me, to all who are among you, not to have too high an opinion of yourselves, but to think reasonably, according as God has given to each one a measure of faith.
For as we have many members in one body, and all the members do not have the same function,
so that we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and we are all members of one another,
having different gifts according to the grace that has been granted to us: If we prophesy, let us prophesy according to the measure of our faith;
if we serve, let us give ourselves to service; if we teach, let us give ourselves to teaching;
if we exhort, let us give ourselves to exhortation; if we give, let us do so generously; if we govern, let us do it with diligence; If we show mercy, let us do it with joy.
May love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Stick to what's good.
In the love of your brethren, have tender affection for one another; in honor, prefer one to the other,
do not delay in applying yourselves, with a fervent spirit, to serve the Lord,
rejoice in hope, endure tribulation, persevere in prayer,
contribute to the needs of the saints, and give hospitality.
Bless those who persecute you; bless, and curse not.
Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.
Have the same feelings towards each other. Do not pretend to exalt yourselves, but associate yourselves with the humble. Don't be wise in your own ideas.
Do not repay evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is honorable in the eyes of all men.
If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
Do not seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but let the wrath of God work. For it is written, "Vengeance is mine, and retribution is mine," says the Lord.
Wherefore, "If thy enemy is hungry, give him something to eat. If he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this, you will gather burning coals on his head. »
Do not allow yourselves to be overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good.
Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities, for there is no authority but from God, and those who exist are ordained by God.
Therefore he who resists authority resists the ordinance of God; and those who resist will receive judgment for themselves.
For rulers are not a terror for good works, but for evil ones. Do you want not to be afraid of authority? Do what is good, and you will have the praise of authority,
for she is to you a servant of God for good. But if you do evil, fear him, for he does not carry the sword in vain, for he is a servant of God, avenger of the wrath of him who does evil.
You must therefore be submissive, not only because of anger, but also for the sake of conscience.
That is why you also pay taxes, for they are servants of God who continually carry out this task.
Render to each one what he owes: if you owe the tax, pay the tax; if it is the customs, then the customs; if it is respect, then respect; If it is honor, then honor.
To owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.
Indeed, the commandments: "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not kill," "You shall not steal," "You shall not covet," and all the other commandments that exist, all boil down to this word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
Love does not hurt one's neighbor. Love is therefore the fulfillment of the law.
Do this, knowing the time, for it is already time for you to awaken from sleep, for salvation is now nearer to us than when we believed.
The night is past, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore put off the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light.
Let us walk aright, as in the daylight, without giving ourselves up to rejoicing and drunkenness, without giving ourselves up to debauchery and lust, without giving ourselves up to quarrels and jealousies.
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not make provision for the flesh, for its lusts.
Now accept the one who is weak in the faith, but not for disputes of opinions.
A man has faith to eat everything, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.
Let not the one who eats despise the one who does not eat. Let not the one who eats judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him.
Who are you to judge the servant of another? It is up to one's own master to stand or fall. Yes, he will stand, for God has the power to make him stand.
A man believes that a day is more important. Another believes that all days are equal. Let everyone be fully reassured in his mind.
He who keeps the day keeps it for the Lord, and he who does not keep the day does not keep it for the Lord. He who eats, eats for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God. He who does not eat, he does not eat to the Lord, and he gives thanks to God.
For none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself.
For if we live, we live for the Lord. Or if we die, we die for the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
For this is why Christ died, rose again, and lived again, to be Lord of the dead and the living.
But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all come before the judgment seat of Christ.
For it is written, 'I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee shall bow before me.' Every tongue will confess to God.'
Therefore, each of us will give an account to God of what he does.
Let us therefore no longer judge one another, but rather judge that no one puts a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion for a fall.
I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, except that for him who considers something unclean, for him it is unclean.
Now, if your brother is afflicted because of food, you no longer walk in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.
Let not your property be slandered,
for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.
So then, let us seek what promotes peace, what edifies one another.
Don't reverse God's work for food. Everything is pure, indeed, but it is bad for man to create a stumbling block by eating.
It is good not to eat meat, not to drink wine, and not to do anything that may cause one's brother to stumble, offend, or weaken.
Do you have faith? Have it for yourselves before God. Happy is he who does not judge himself in what he approves.
But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not faith; and everything that is not of faith is sin.
Now, we who are strong, we must put up with the weaknesses of the weak, and not please ourselves.
Let each one of us please his neighbor for what is good, in order to edify him.
For even Christ did not please himself. But, as it is written, "The outrages of those who revile you have fallen upon me."
For all that was written before was written for our instruction, that by perseverance and by the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.
Now may the God of perseverance and encouragement grant you to have the same feelings toward one another according to Jesus Christ,
so that, with one accord, you may glorify with one mouth the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Accept one another, therefore, as Christ accepted you, for the glory of God.
Now I say that Christ was made a servant of the circumcised for the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises made to the fathers,
and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles . . . and sing to your name. »
He also said, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."
Again, "Praise the Lord, all you pagans! Let all peoples praise him. »
Again, Isaiah says, "There shall be the root of Jesse, he who arises to reign over the Gentiles; in him the pagans will hope."
Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in faith, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
I myself am persuaded about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of goodness, full of all knowledge, and also capable of exhorting others.
But I am writing to you with all the more boldness, partly to remind you, because of the grace that has been granted to me by God,
that I must be a servant of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of the Good News of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be made pleasing, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
It is therefore in Christ Jesus that I glory in the things of God.
For I dare not speak of any other things than those which Christ has done through me for the obedience of the Gentiles, in word and deed,
by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that, from Jerusalem and around to Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ;
yes, by striving to proclaim the Good News, not where Christ was already appointed, so as not to build on the foundation of others.
But, as it is written, "They shall see, they to whom no news of him has come. Those who have not heard will understand. »
That is why I have often been prevented from going to you,
but now that I have no place in these regions, and that I have long desired to come to you,
every time I go to Spain, I will go to you. For I hope to see you on the way and to be helped by you, if first I can enjoy your company a little.
But now, I say to you, I am going to Jerusalem, in the service of the saints.
For Macedonia and Achaia have been willing to make a contribution for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem.
Yes, it is their good pleasure, and they are indebted to it. For if the pagans have been made partakers of their spiritual goods, they also owe it to them to serve them in material goods.
So when I have accomplished this, and have sealed this fruit to them, I will pass through your house on my way to Spain.
I know that when I come to you, I will arrive in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.
Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to unite yourselves with me in the prayers which you address to God for me,
that I may be delivered from the rebels of Judea, and that the service I have to do in Jerusalem may be pleasing to the saints,
that I may come to you in joy, according to the will of God, and find rest with you.
May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the congregation at Cenchrea,
so that you may receive her into the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and help her in all that she may ask of you, for she also has been useful to many, and to me.
Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
who have risked their lives for mine, and to whom I give thanks, not only to myself, but also to all the assemblies of the Gentiles.
Greet the congregation that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruit of Achaia for Christ.
Greet Mary, who has worked a lot for us.
Greet Andronicus and Junia, my parents and companions in captivity, who are distinguished among the apostles, and who were also in Christ before me.
Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.
Greet Urbanus, our fellow laborer in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.
Greet Apelles, who was approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the house of Aristobulus.
Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet the members of Narcissus' family, who are in the Lord.
Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who work in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who has worked much in the Lord.
Greet Rufus, the chosen one in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren who are with them.
Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
Greet one another with a holy kiss. The assemblies of Christ greet you.
Now, I beseech you, brethren, beware of those who cause divisions and occasions of sin, contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and turn away from them.
For these people do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own womb, and they deceive the hearts of the innocent with flattering speeches.
For your obedience has been known to all. I am therefore delighted about you. But I want you to be wise in what is good, but innocent in what is bad.
And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Timothy, my co-worker, greets you, as well as Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives.
I, Tertius, who write the letter, greet you in the Lord.
Gaius, my guest and the guest of the whole assembly, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, as well as Quartus, the brother.
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.
Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place, among them and among us:
Grace and peace be to you, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I always give thanks to my God for you, for the grace of God that has been given to you in Christ Jesus,
that you may be enriched in all things by him, in all word and in all knowledge,
as the testimony of Christ has been confirmed in you,
that you may not be late in any gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who will also confirm you to the end, blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
God is faithful, by whom you have been called to the communion of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you may all speak of the same thing, and that there may be no divisions among you, but that you may be perfected together in the same spirit and in the same judgment.
For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of the house of Chloe, that there are disputes among you.
Now, I mean that each of you says: "I am Paul", "I am Apollos", "I am Cephas", and "I am the Christ".
Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or have you been baptized in Paul's name?
I thank God that I have not baptized any of you, except Crispus and Gaius,
so that no one may say that I have baptized you in my own name.
(I also baptized the house of Stephanas; apart from them, I don't know if I baptized others).
For it is not to baptize that Christ has sent me, but to preach the Good News, without wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ may not be annulled.
For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who die, but to us who are saved, it is a power of God.
For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise. I will destroy the discernment of those who know how to discern. »
Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the orator of this century? Has not God made the wisdom of this world foolish?
For since, in the wisdom of God, the world has not known God, God has willed, by the folly of preaching, to save those who believe.
For the Jews ask for signs, the Greeks seek wisdom,
but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block for the Jews and folly for the Greeks,
but to those who are called, Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God,
for the folly of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
For you see your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, nor many powerful, nor many noble;
but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. God has chosen the weak things of the world, to cover the strong things with shame.
God chose the humble things of the world, the despised things, the things that do not exist, in order to bring to naught the things that exist,
so that no flesh may glory before God.
It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who was made for us the wisdom of God, righteousness, sanctification and redemption,
so that, as it is written, "He that boasteth boasteth boasteth in the Lord."
When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with the power of word or wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
For I have resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ crucified.
I have been with you in weakness, in fear, and in great trembling.
My discourse and preaching were not persuasive words of human wisdom, but a demonstration of the Spirit and power,
so that your faith may not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
We, however, speak of wisdom, among those who have reached maturity, but of a wisdom that is not that of this world nor that of the rulers of this world, who are about to disappear.
But we speak of the wisdom of God in a mystery, of the hidden wisdom, which God prepared before the worlds for our glory,
and which none of the rulers of this world has known. For if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But, as it is written, "Things which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, which hath not entered into the heart of man, which God hath prepared for them that love him."
But to us, God has revealed them by the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
For who among men knows the things of a man, but the spirit of man that is in him? In the same way, no one knows the things of God, except the Spirit of God.
Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that comes from God, that we may know the things that have been freely given to us by God.
We also speak of these things, not with the words that the wisdom of men teaches, but with those that the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
Now the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he must not be judged by anyone.
"For who has known the mind of the Lord to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.
Brethren, I have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to carnal people, as children in Christ.
I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not yet ready. And even now, you are not ready,
for you are still carnal. For if there is jealousy, strife, and division among you, are you not carnal, and walk in the ways of men?
For if one says, "I am Paul," and the other, "I am Apollos," are you not carnal?
Who, then, is Apollos, and who is Paul, if not servants through whom you believed, and every one according to what the Lord has given him?
I crashed. Apollos watered. But it is God who has given the increase.
Therefore neither he who plants is nothing, nor he who waters, but God who makes it grow.
Now the one who plants and the one who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own work.
For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's agriculture, God's construction.
According to the grace of God which has been given to me, I have laid, as a wise master, a foundation, and another built upon it. But let everyone be careful how he builds on it.
For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, that is, Jesus Christ.
But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,
The work of each one will be unveiled. For the Day will make him known, because he reveals himself in fire; and the fire itself will test what is the work of each one.
If any one remains of what he has built on it, he will receive a reward.
If anyone's work is burned, he will suffer a loss, but he will be saved himself, but as by fire.
Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, which you are.
Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks he is wise among you in this world, let him go mad to become wise.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, "He has caught the wise in their cunning."
And again: "The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise: they are worthless."
Let no one therefore glory in men. For all things are yours,
either Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. Everything is yours,
and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
Let man, therefore, consider us as the servants of Christ and the stewards of the mysteries of God.
Here, moreover, the intendants are required to be found faithful.
But for me, it is very little that I should be judged by you, or by a human tribunal. Yes, I don't even judge myself.
For I know nothing against myself. And it is not I who am justified by this, but the one who judges me is the Lord.
Therefore judge nothing before the time comes, until the Lord comes, who will bring to light what is hidden in darkness, and who will reveal the purposes of hearts. Then each one will receive his praise from God.
Now, brethren, I have transferred these things figuratively to myself and to Apollos, for your sake, so that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, and that neither of you may be inflamed against another.
Because who sets you apart? And what have you that you have not received? But if you have received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
You are already satisfied. You've already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I would that you would reign, that we also might reign with you!
For I think that God showed us, the apostles, in the last place, as condemned to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men.
We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have glory, but we have dishonor.
At this moment we are hungry, we are thirsty, we are naked, we are beaten, and we have no safe abode.
We toil, we work with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless. We are persecuted, but we endure.
We are defamed, we beg. We are made like the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, until now.
I do not write these things to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.
For if you have ten thousand preceptors in Christ, you have not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I have become your father through the Good News.
I beg you, therefore, to imitate me.
Therefore I have sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach everywhere in all assemblies.
Now, some people puff themselves up with pride, as if I did not come to you.
But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills. And I will know, not the word of those who puff themselves up, but the power.
For the Kingdom of God is not in words, but in power.
What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and in a spirit of gentleness?
For it is reported that there is among you a sexual immorality, and a sexual immorality such as is not even called among the pagans, that one has his father's wife.
You are arrogant, and you have not rather mourned, so that the one who has committed this deed may be removed from among you.
For I, absent in body but present in mind, have already judged, as if I were present, the one who committed this action.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are reunited with my spirit by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
you will deliver such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast makes the whole mass rise?
Get rid of the old leaven, so that you may be a new dough, as you are unleavened. Indeed, Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed in our place.
Let us therefore celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with a leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexual sinners;
but not at all with the sexual sinners of this world, nor with the greedy and extortionists, nor with the idolaters, for then you would have to leave the world.
Now I have written to you not to associate with one who is called a brother, and who is a sexual sinner, or a greedy, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don't even eat with such a person.
Indeed, what do I have to do with judging also those who are outside? Do you not judge those who are within?
But it is God who judges those outside. "Eliminate the wicked from among yourselves."
Will any of you, having a case against your neighbor, go to justice before the unjust, and not before the saints?
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if it is you who judge the world, are you unworthy to judge the smallest things?
Do you not know that we will judge the angels? Much more do things that concern this life?
If, then, you have to judge things that pertain to this life, do you put them to judge those who are of no importance in the assembly?
I say this to shame you. Is there not one wise man among you who is able to decide between his brothers?
But the brother goes to court with the brother, and that before infidels!
It is therefore already quite a defect on your part to bring lawsuits against one another. Why not be wronged instead? Why not prefer the scam?
No, but it is you yourselves who commit injustice and fraud, and that against your brethren.
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Make no mistake. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor prostitutes, nor homosexuals,
neither thieves, nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortionists, will inherit the Kingdom of God.
Some of you were such, but they were washed. You have been sanctified. You have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
"Everything is allowed to me", but not everything is allowed to me. "Everything is permitted to me, but I will not submit to anything.
"Food for the belly, and the belly for food," but God will bring them and them to naught. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
Now God has raised the Lord from the dead, and he will also raise us up by his power.
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? May it never be so!
Or do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute forms but one body? For "both," he says, "will become one flesh."
But he who is united to the Lord is one spirit.
Flee from sexual immorality! "Every sin committed by a man is external to the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.
Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, and which you have received from God? You do not belong to yourselves,
because you have been acquired at a high price. Glorify God therefore in your body and in your spirit, which belong to God.
As for the things you have written to me about, it is good that a man does not touch a woman.
But, because of sexual immoralities, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
Let the husband give to his wife the affection due to her, and likewise the wife to her husband.
The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband has authority over it. Similarly, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife has authority over it.
Do not deprive each other, unless it is by common consent for a time, in order to give yourselves up to fasting and prayer, and to be together, so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
But I say this by concession, not by command.
Yet I would like all men to be like me. But every man has his own gift of God, one of this kind, the other of this kind.
But I tell singles and widows that it is good for them to stay like me.
But if they don't have self-control, let them get married. Because it is better to get married than to burn out of passion.
But to the bride and groom I command, not I, but the Lord, that the wife not leave her husband
(but if she leaves him, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled with her husband), and the husband does not leave his wife.
But as for the others, I say, and not the Lord, that if a brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.
The woman who has a non-believing husband, and who is happy to live with her, let her not leave her husband.
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
However, if the non-believer leaves, let there be separation. In such a case, the brother or sister is not enslaved, but God has called us to peace.
For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
Only, as the Lord has distributed to each one, as God has called each one, let him walk thus. This is what I command in all assemblies.
Has anyone been called without having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but what matters is to keep the commandments of God.
May each one remain in the vocation to which he has been called.
Have you been called to be a servant? Don't let it bother you, but if you have the opportunity to free yourself, take it.
For he who has been called in the Lord as a slave is the free man of the Lord. In the same way, he who has been called free is the servant of Christ.
You have been bought at a high price. Do not become slaves of men.
Brethren, let every man, in whatever condition he may have been called, remain in this condition with God.
Now, as far as virgins are concerned, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained the Lord's mercy to be trustworthy.
That is why I think that because of the distress that befalls us, it is good for a man to remain as he is.
Are you related to a woman? Do not try to free yourself from it. Are you free from a woman? Don't try to get married.
But if you get married, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such people will be oppressed in the flesh, and I will spare you.
But I tell you, brothers: time is pressing. From now on, those who have wives will be as if they had none;
and those who weep, as if they were not weeping; and those who rejoice, as if they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as if they did not possess;
and those who use the world, as if they did not make full use of it. For the mode of this world passes.
But I want you to be free from any worries. He who is not married is anxious about the things of the Lord, how he can please the Lord;
but he who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how he can please his wife.
There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman occupies herself with the things of the Lord, in order to be holy in body and mind. But she who is married is interested in the things of the world, to please her husband.
I say this for your sake, not to ensnare you, but for what is proper, so that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.
But if anyone thinks that he is behaving inappropriately towards his virgin, if she is past the prime of life, and if the need arises, let him do what he wills. He does not sin. Let them get married.
But he who remains firm in his heart, without urgency, but who is master of his own will, and who has decided in his heart to keep his own virgin, does well.
Therefore he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage does better.
The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to marry whomever she wants, only in the Lord.
But she is happier if she stays as she is, according to my judgment, and I think I also have the Spirit of God.
Now, as for the things sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge swells, but love edifies.
But if anyone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know what he needs to know.
But he who loves God is known to him.
Thus, as to eating meat sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no idol in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
For if there are things which are called "gods," either in heaven or on earth, as there are many "gods" and many "lords,"
for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things come, and we for him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come, and we live through him.
However, this knowledge is not in all men. But some, having hitherto been conscious of an idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
But food will not recommend us to God. For neither if we do not eat, we are worse, nor if we eat, we are better.
But take care that this freedom of yours does not become a stumbling block for the weak.
For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, sitting in the temple of an idol, will not his conscience, if it be weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
And it is by your knowledge that the weak, the brother for whom Christ died, perishes.
Thus, by sinning against the brethren, and by wounding their consciences when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not trip my brother.
Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
If I am not an apostle for others, I am at least an apostle for you, for you are the seal of my apostolate in the Lord.
Here is my defense before those who examine me:
Don't we have the right to eat and drink?
Have we not the right to take with us a believing woman, like the other apostles, the Lord's brethren, and Cephas?
Or do we not have the right, Barnabas and I, not to work?
What soldier ever served at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and does not drink the milk of the flock?
Do I say these things in the manner of men? Or does the law not say the same thing?
For it is written in the law of Moses, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox while it treads the grain." Is it for the oxen that God is anxious,
Or is it for us that he says it? Yes, it was written for us, for he who ploughs must plough with hope, and he who threshes with hope must share in his hope.
If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things?
If others have a share in this right over you, have we not even more? Nevertheless, we have not used this right, but we endure everything, so as not to hinder the Good News of Christ.
Do you not know that those who serve around sacred things eat things of the temple, and that those who serve the altar have their share with the altar?
In the same way, the Lord has willed that those who proclaim the Good News live by this Good News.
But I have not used any of these things, and I do not write these things to make it so in my case; for I would rather die than see someone cancel my boast.
For if I preach the Good News, I have no reason to boast, for the necessity is imposed on me; but woe to me if I do not preach the Good News.
For if I do this of my own free will, I have a reward. But if it is not of my own volition, it is a charge entrusted to me.
What is my reward? That when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ at no cost, so that I do not abuse my authority in the Good News.
For, although I am free with regard to all, I have made myself a slave to all, in order to gain the greatest number.
As for the Jews, I became a Jew, in order to win over the Jews; for the slaves of the law, as slaves of the law, in order to gain the slaves of the law;
for the lawless, as without law (not being lawless to God, but under law to Christ), in order to win the lawless.
For the weak, I made myself weak, in order to win over the weak. I have become all things to all men, in order to save some by all means.
Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, so that I may share in it in common.
Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run thus, in order to win.
Every man who strives in games exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.
That's why I run like this, not without purpose. I fight like this, not by beating the air,
but by beating my body and subduing it, lest after preaching to others I should be disqualified.
Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, that they all passed by the sea,
that they were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
that they all ate the same spiritual food,
that they all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.
However, God was not pleased with most of them, as they were overthrown in the wilderness.
Now these things have served us as examples, so that we may not covet evil things, as they coveted them.
Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to play."
Let us not indulge in fornication, as some of them did, and in a single day twenty-three thousand people fell.
Let us not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and they perished by serpents.
Do not grumble, as some of them grumbled and perished by the destroyer.
Now all these things have happened to them as an example, and they have been written for our instruction, upon whom the end of time has come.
Let him who thinks he is standing take care not to fall.
No temptation has seized you, except that which is common to man. God is faithful, he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength, but he will open with temptation the way of flight, so that you can bear it.
Therefore, my beloveds, flee from idolatry.
I speak as if to wise men. Judge of what I say.
Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
Because there is one bread, we, who are many, form one body, for we all partake of one bread.
Consider Israel according to the flesh. Do not those who eat the sacrifices partake of the altar?
What am I saying? That a thing sacrificed to idols is something, or that an idol is something?
But I say that the things that the pagans sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons.
You cannot drink both the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot participate in both the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than him?
"Everything is allowed to me", but not everything is profitable. 23 "Everything is permitted to me", but not everything is profitable.
Let no one seek his own good, but let each seek the good of his neighbor.
Everything that is sold in the butcher's shop, eat it, without asking questions for the conscience,
for "the earth is the Lord's, and its fullness."
If someone of those who do not believe invites you to eat, and you want to go, eat what is offered to you, without asking questions of conscience.
But if anyone says to you, "This has been offered to idols," do not eat of it, out of consideration for the one who told you and for the sake of your conscience. For "the earth is the Lord's, in all its fullness".
Conscience, I say, not yours, but that of the other. For why should my freedom be judged by another conscience?
If I participate with gratitude, why am I denounced for something for which I am grateful?
So, whether you eat or drink, or do anything, do everything for the glory of God.
Do not give any occasion for sin, either to the Jews, or to the Greeks, or to the assembly of God;
just as I also am pleasing to all in all things, seeking not my own advantage, but the advantage of many, that they may be saved.
Be imitators of me, as I myself am of Christ.
Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things, and that you hold fast to the traditions, as I have handed them down to you.
But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, that the head of woman is man, and that the head of Christ is God.
Every man who prays or prophesies, with his head covered, dishonors his head.
But every woman who prays or prophesies, with her head uncovered, dishonors her head. Because it's one and the same thing as if it were razed.
Because if a woman is not covered, let her hair be cut too. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved, let her be covered.
For man must not cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man.
For man does not come from woman, but woman comes from man;
for man was not created for woman, but woman for man.
Therefore the woman must have authority over her own head, for the angels' sake.
Nevertheless, in the Lord, woman is not independent of man, nor man independent of woman.
For as woman is descended from man, so man is descended from woman; but everything comes from God.
Judge for yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God without being veiled?
Does not nature herself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him?
But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for covering.
But if anyone seems to be arguing, we don't have that custom, nor the assemblies of God.
But in giving you this commandment, I do not congratulate you, for you are meeting not for the better, but for the worse.
For in the first place, when you meet in assembly, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I believe it in part.
For there must also be divisions among you, so that those who are approved may be revealed among you.
So when you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper that you eat.
Because, in your meals, everyone first takes his own meal. One is hungry, and the other is drunk.
What, have you not houses to eat and drink? Or do you despise God's congregation and shame those who do not have enough? What shall I tell you? Should I hire you? In this, I do not praise you.
For I have received from the Lord what I have also transmitted to you, namely, that the Lord Jesus, in the night that he was betrayed, took bread.
After giving thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat." This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me. »
In the same way, after the meal, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, every time you drink of it, in remembrance of me. »
For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
But let a man examine himself, and thus let him eat bread and drink from the cup.
For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment on himself, if he does not discern the body of the Lord.
That is why many of you are weak and sick, and there are not many who are sleeping.
For if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged.
But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, so that we are not condemned with the world.
Therefore, my brethren, when you gather together to eat, wait for one another.
But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that your meeting may not be a judgment. The rest I will put in order when I come.
Now, as far as spiritual things are concerned, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant.
You know that when you were pagans, you allowed yourselves to be drawn into these dumb idols, no matter how you let yourselves be led.
Wherefore I make known unto you that no one, speaking by the Spirit of God, says, "Jesus is cursed." No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
There are many kinds of gifts, but one and the same Spirit.
There are various kinds of services, and the same Lord.
There are various kinds of works, but the same God who works all things in all.
But to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the benefit of all.
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,
to another faith by the same Spirit, to another the gift of healings by the same Spirit,
to another the action of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another the diversity of languages, to another the interpretation of tongues.
But it is one and the same Spirit who produces all this, distributing to each one separately what he wants.
For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, form but one body, so it is with Christ.
For it is in one Spirit that we have all been baptized into one body, Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and that we have all been watered in one Spirit.
For the body is not one member, but many.
If the foot says, "I am not the hand, I am not part of the body," then it is not part of the body.
If the ear said, "Because I am not the eye, I am not part of the body," then it would not be part of the body.
If the whole body were an eye, where would hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would smell be?
But now God has placed the members, each of them, in the body, as He willed.
If they were all one member, where would the body be?
But now they are many members, but one body.
The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you," nor from head to toe, "I don't need you."
No, rather, the members of the body that seem weaker are necessary.
The parts of the body which seem less honorable to us, we honor more abundantly; and our non-visible parts have more modesty,
while our visible parts do not need it. But God has composed the body together, giving more honor to the lower part,
so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for each other.
If one limb suffers, all the limbs suffer with it. When a member is honored, all members rejoice with him.
Now you are the body of Christ, and its members individually.
God has appointed some in the assembly: first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then thaumaturgists, then gifts of healing, assistance, government, and various languages.
Are all apostles? Are they all prophets? Are they all teachers? Are they all miracle workers?
Do they all have healing gifts? Do they all speak in various languages? Do they all interpret?
But ardently desire the best gifts. Besides, I am showing you an excellent way.
If I speak the tongues of men and angels, but have not charity, I am only a brass that resounds or a cymbal that sounds.
If I have the gift of prophecy, if I know all the mysteries and all the science, if I have all the faith to move mountains, but I have not charity, I am nothing.
If I give all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give up my body to be burned, but I do not have charity, it is of no use to me.
Love is patient and it is good. Love is not envious. Love does not boast, is not proud,
does not behave inappropriately, does not seek his own way, does not allow himself to be provoked, does not take evil into account;
does not rejoice in injustice, but rejoices in the truth;
excuse all, believe all, hope all, and endure all.
Love is never lacking. But where there are prophecies, they will be suppressed. Where there are diverse languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will disappear.
For we know in part and prophesy in part;
but when that which is complete has arrived, that which is partial will disappear.
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I felt like a child, I thought like a child. Now that I have become a man, I have gotten rid of childish things.
For now we see in a mirror, faintly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, as I have also been fully known.
But now there remains faith, hope and charity, these three. The greatest of these is love.
Follow love and long for spiritual gifts, but especially that of prophesying.
For he who speaks in another tongue does not speak to men, but to God; for no one understands, but it is by the Spirit that he speaks mysteries.
But he who prophesies speaks to men to edify, exhort and console them.
He who speaks in a foreign tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.
Now I desire that you should all speak in other tongues, but still more that you should prophesy. For he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in other tongues, unless he interprets, so that the assembly may be edified.
But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in other languages, what shall I serve you, if I do not speak to you by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by teaching?
Even lifeless things that make noise, whether the flute or the harp, if they did not give a distinction in the sounds, how would anyone know what is flute or harp?
For if the trumpet emitted an uncertain sound, who would prepare for war?
In the same way, if you did not speak words that were easy to understand in your tongue, how would anyone know what is being said? For you would be talking in the air.
There may be so many different languages in the world, and none of them is meaningless.
If, therefore, I do not know the meaning of the language, I would be a stranger to him who speaks, and he who speaks would be a stranger to me.
So you also, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek to abound for the edification of the assembly.
Let him who speaks another language pray that he may interpret .
For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is fruitless.
What must I do? I will pray by the spirit, and I will also pray by the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding.
Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the ignorant say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you say?
For you certainly give thanks, but the other is not edified.
I thank my God, I speak other languages more than all of you.
However, in the assembly, I prefer to say five words with my understanding, in order to instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.
Brethren, do not be children in your thoughts, and do not show malice, but be mature in your thoughts.
It is written in the law: "It is by men of foreign tongues and by the lips of strangers that I will speak to this people. They will not even listen to me in this way, says the Lord. »
Therefore other tongues are a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelievers; but prophecy is a sign, not to the unbelievers, but to those who believe.
If, then, the whole assembly is assembled, and all speak in other tongues, and uneducated or unbelieving persons enter, will they not say that you are mad?
But if all prophesy, and anyone who is an unbeliever or uncultured enters, he is rebuked by all, and he is judged by all.
And so the secrets of his heart are revealed. Then he will bow down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is truly in your midst.
What then, brothers? When you come together, each of you has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, another language or an interpretation. Let everything be done to edify each other.
If anyone speaks in another language, let there be two, or at most three, and in turn, and let only one interpret.
But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in the assembly, and speak to himself and to God.
Let two or three of the prophets speak, and let the others discern.
But if a revelation is made to another sitting next to him, let the first one be silent.
For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted.
The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,
for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace, as in all assemblies of saints.
Let the women be silent in the assemblies, for they have not been permitted to speak, except with submission, as the law also says,
if they want to learn something. "Let them ask their husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the assembly."
What!? Is it from you that the word of God has come? Or has it reached you alone?
If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize the things that I am writing to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.
But if anyone is ignorant, let him be.
Therefore, brethren, have an ardent desire to prophesy, and do not forbid the speaking of other tongues.
That everything happens in a proper and orderly manner.
I now declare to you, brethren, the good news which I have preached to you, which you have also received, in which you also stand,
by which also you are saved, if you hold fast to the word which I have spoken to you - unless you have believed in vain.
I have conveyed to you first of all what I myself have received, namely, that according to the Scriptures, Christ died for our sins,
that he was buried, that he rose again on the third day, according to the Scriptures,
and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the twelve.
Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at a time, most of whom have remained until now, but some of whom have also fallen asleep.
He then appeared to James, and then to all the apostles,
and finally, as to the child born out of time, to me too he appeared.
For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God.
But it is by the grace of God that I am what I am. The grace granted to me was not in vain; but I have worked harder than all of them, not I, but the grace of God who was with me.
So whether it is I or them, so we preach, and so you have believed.
Now, if it is preached that Christ rose from the dead, how do some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither is Christ risen.
If Christ is not risen, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.
Yes, we are also found to be false witnesses of God, because we have testified to God that he raised Christ, that he did not rise, if it is true that the dead do not rise.
For if the dead do not rise, neither is Christ risen.
If Christ is not risen, your faith is in vain; you are still in your sins.
And those who fell asleep in Christ perished.
If we have hoped in Christ only in this life, we are of all men the most to be pitied.
But now, Christ has risen from the dead. It has become the first fruit of those who sleep.
For since death came from man, the resurrection of the dead also came from man.
For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
But each according to his own order: Christ, the firstfruits, and then those that will belong to Christ at his coming.
Then will come the end, when he will hand over the Kingdom to God the Father, when he will have abolished all dominion, all authority, and all power.
For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
For "he has subdued all things under his feet." But when he says, "All things are subject to him," it is evident that it is he who has subjected all things to him.
When all things have been submitted to him, then the Son also will be subject to him who has subjected all things to him, so that God may be all in all.
Or what will those who are baptized for the dead do? If the dead do not rise at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?
Why are we too, every hour, in danger?
I affirm, by the boasting that I have in you in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I die every day.
If in Ephesus I fought with animals for human purposes, what does that bring me? If the dead do not rise, then "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die".
Don't let that fool you! "Bad company corrupts good morals".
Wake up righteously, and do not sin, for some do not know God. I say this for your shame.
But someone will say, "How do the dead rise?" and "What kind of bodies do they come with?"
You, the fool, what you sow yourself is not made alive unless it dies.
What you sow, you do not sow the body, which will be, but a naked grain, perhaps of wheat, or of another kind.
But God gives him a body as he pleases, and to each seed a body of its own.
Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is the flesh of men, another of animals, another of fish, another of birds.
There are also heavenly bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestials differs from that of the earthly.
There is a glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.
The same is true of the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown perishable, it rises again imperishable.
He was sown in dishonor, he rises in glory. He is sown in weakness, he rises in power.
It is sown in a natural body, it rises again in a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is also a spiritual body.
Thus, it is also written: "The first man, Adam, became a living soul." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
However, what is spiritual is not first, but what is natural, then what is spiritual.
The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord of heaven.
Such is he who is made of dust, so are those who are also made of dust; and such is the celestial, such are also those who are celestial.
As we have borne the image of those who are made of dust, let us also bear the image of those who are heavenly.
Now I say this, brethren: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and perishable things do not inherit imperishable things.
Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,
in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
For this perishable body must become imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.
But when this perishable body shall have become imperishable, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall that which is written shall come to pass: "Death has been swallowed up in victory."
"Death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory? »
The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
But thanks be to God, who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, steadfast, persevering in the Lord's work, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
Now, as to the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, do likewise.
On the first day of each week, let each of you make the savings that suits you, so that there will be no collection when I arrive.
When I arrive, I will send the one you approve with letters to carry to Jerusalem the gift you have given me.
If it is appropriate for me to go there also, they will go with me.
I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.
But it may be that I will stay with you, or even that I will winter with you, so that you may send me on a journey, wherever I go.
For I do not want to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits.
But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,
for a great and effective door has been opened to me, and the adversaries are many.
Now, if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he is doing the work of the Lord, as am I.
Let no one despise him. But make him go forward in peace in his journey, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren.
As for Brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but he did not want to come now; but he will come when he has the opportunity.
Look! Stand firm in the faith! Be brave! Be strong!
Let everything you do be done in love.
Now, I pray you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanas, which is the first in Achaia, and which has placed itself at the service of the saints.
to be subject equally to them, as well as to all those who participate in the work and work.
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for they have filled what you lacked.
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Recognize therefore those who do so.
The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, as well as the congregation that is in their house.
All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
This greeting is from me, Paul, in my own hand.
If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed. Come, Lord!
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you!
I greet you all in Jesus Christ. Amen.
Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the will of God, and Timothy, our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia.
Grace and peace be to you, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all consolation,
who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may console those who are in some affliction, by the consolation with which we ourselves are consoled by God.
For as the sufferings of Christ abound us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ.
But if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation. If we are consoled, it is for your consolation, which produces in you patience in the same sufferings as we do.
Our hope for you is unshakeable, knowing that, since you share in suffering, you also share in consolation.
For we do not wish to leave you, brethren, ignorant of the trial which has befallen us in Asia: we have been overwhelmed beyond our strength, to the point of despairing even of life.
Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, so that we may not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,
who delivered us from so great a death, and who delivers, in whom we have placed our hope that he will deliver us again,
You also join in our favor by your supplications, so that, for the gift that has been made to us through the intermediary of many, thanks may be rendered by many persons in your favor.
For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in the holiness and sincerity of God, not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly towards you.
For we write to you nothing other than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope that you will recognize to the end -
as you have also acknowledged us in part - that we are your boast, as you are also ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
In this confidence, I was resolved to come first to you, so that you might derive a second advantage from it,
to go through you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent by you on a journey to Judea.
When I designed these projects, was I inconsistent? Or do the things that I project, do I project them according to the flesh, so that there may be "yes, yes" and "no, no" in me?
But as God is faithful, our word to you has not been "Yes and no".
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we, I, Silvanus, and Timothy preached among you, was not "yes and no," but in him it is "yes."
In fact, whatever the number of God's promises, the "yes" is in him. Therefore also through him is the "Amen", to the glory of God through us.
Now he who has established us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,
who also sealed us and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.
But I call upon God as a witness of my soul, that, to spare you, I have not come to Corinth.
We do not control your faith, but we are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in the faith.
But I have decided for myself not to come to you in sorrow anymore.
For if I grieve you, who will rejoice me, but the one whom I grieve?
And I have written this very thing to you, so that when I come, I may not be grieved by those whom I should rejoice, trusting in you all that my joy may be shared by you all.
For it was in distress and anguish of heart that I wrote to you with many tears, not to grieve you, but to make you know the love I have so abundantly for you.
But if anyone has caused pain, it is not to me that he has caused it, but partly to all of you, so that I may not press you too much.
This punishment inflicted by the multitude is sufficient for such a man;
therefore, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest such a man be swallowed up by his too great sorrow.
That is why I beg you to confirm your love for him.
For it is for this purpose that I have also written, in order to know the trial of you, to know whether you are obedient in all things.
Now, I also forgive whoever you forgive something. For if I have forgiven anything, it is for you that I have done it in the presence of Christ,
so that Satan may not gain an advantage over us, for we are not ignorant of his designs.
Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,
I had no relief for my spirit, because I had not found Titus, my brother; but, taking leave of them, I went to Macedonia.
Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and who reveals through us everywhere the pleasant odor of his knowledge.
For we are a sweet smell of Christ to God, to those who are saved and to those who perish:
for some, a smell of death to death, for others, a pleasant smell of life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?
For we are not like so many others, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, as of God, before God, we speak in Christ.
Are we starting to recommend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation for you or on your behalf?
You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh.
It is through Christ that we have this trust in God,
not that we are capable of accounting for anything on our own; but our self-sufficiency comes from God,
which has also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
But if the service of death, written on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses, because of the glory of his countenance, which passed away,
will not the service of the Spirit be with much more glory?
For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of justice has much more glory.
For, most certainly, that which has been made glorious has not been so in this respect, because of the glory which surpasses.
For if what passes away was with glory, much more is what remains in glory.
Having therefore such a hope, we have great boldness of speech,
and not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel would not look firmly at the end of what was passing.
But their minds have become hardened, for to this day, when the old covenant is read, the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes.
But to this day, when one reads Moses, a veil remains over their hearts.
But as soon as anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
And all of us, with our faces unveiled, seeing the glory of the Lord as in a mirror, are transformed into one image, from glory to glory, as by the Lord, the Spirit.
Therefore, since we have this ministry, just as we have obtained mercy, we do not falter.
But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking by cunning and not handling the word of God with deceit, but recommending ourselves to the conscience of every man before God, by the manifestation of the truth.
If our Good News is veiled, it is also veiled in the dying,
in whom the god of this world has blinded the understanding of the unbelievers, so that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not appear upon them.
For it is not ourselves that we preach, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake,
for it is God who has said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
But we have this treasure in vessels of clay, so that the extreme greatness of the power may be of God and not of ourselves.
We are pressed on all sides, but not crushed; perplexed, but not desperate;
pursued, but not abandoned; felled but not destroyed;
always bearing in the body the condemnation to death of the Lord Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.
For we who live are always given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.
Thus death acts in us, but life acts in you.
But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written, "I believed, and therefore I spoke." We also believe, and that is why we also speak,
knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and present us with you.
For all this is for your sake, so that grace, being multiplied by the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
That is why we do not falter; but, although our external person is decomposing, our inner person is renewed day by day.
For our slight tribulation, which is for the moment, procures us more and more an eternal weight of glory,
while we do not look at the things that are visible, but at those that are not seen. For the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.
For we know that if the earthly house that serves us as a tent is destroyed, we have a building that comes from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in heaven.
For there we groan, longing to be clothed with the dwelling place in heaven,
if, however, being clothed, we are not to be found naked.
For we who are in this tent groan and are overwhelmed, not that we desire to be despoiled, but we desire to be clothed, that life may swallow up that which is mortal.
Now, the One who created us for this is God, who also gave us the down payment of the Spirit.
That is why we are always trusting and we know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;
for we walk by faith and not by sight.
We are courageous, I say, and we rather want to be absent from the body and be at home with the Lord.
That's why we strive to be pleasing to him, whether we're at home or away.
For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due to him in the body according to what he has done, for good or for evil.
Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God, and I hope that we are also revealed in your consciences.
For we do not recommend ourselves to you again, but we speak as if to give you an opportunity to glory in our behalf, so that you may have something to answer those who glory in appearance and not in heart.
For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God's sake. And if we are sober of mind, it is for you.
For the love of Christ compels us to do so; for we judge thus: One died for all, therefore all died.
He died for all, so that those who live no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose for them.
That is why we now know no one according to the flesh. If we have known Christ according to the flesh, now we no longer know Him in this way.
Thus, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have disappeared. Behold, all things have become new.
Now everything comes from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and who has entrusted us with the ministry of reconciliation,
that is, God has reconciled the world to himself in Christ, without imputing to them their faults, and has entrusted to us the word of reconciliation.
We are therefore ambassadors in the name of Christ, as if God were praying through us: we beseech you in the name of Christ, be reconciled to God.
For he who did not know sin he caused him to become sin in our place, so that we might become in him the righteousness of God.
Working together, we also beseech you not to receive God's grace in vain.
For he says, "At an acceptable moment, I listened to you. On the day of salvation, I helped you. Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.
We give no occasion for sin in anything, so that our service may not be blamed,
but we commend ourselves in all things as servants of God: in great perseverance, in afflictions, in privations, in distresses,
in beatings, in prisons, in riots, in work, in vigils, in fasts,
in purity, in knowledge, in perseverance, in goodness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,
in the word of truth, in the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
by glory and dishonor, by bad and good name, as deceitful and yet truthful,
as unknown and yet well known, as dying, and here we live, as punished and not killed,
as afflicted and yet always joyful, as poor and yet enriching many people, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.
Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our hearts have expanded.
You are not limited by us, but you are limited by your own affections.
Now, in return - I speak as to my children - you too, open your hearts.
Do not put yourselves under a foreign yoke with the infidels, for what is the connection between righteousness and iniquity? Or what is the communion of light with darkness?
What agreement does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?
What agreement does God's temple have with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. Just as God said, "I will dwell in them and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people. »
Wherefore, 'Come out from among them, and be separated,' says the Lord. Do not touch anything impure. I will receive you.
I will be a Father to you. You shall be sons and daughters to me, saith the Lord Almighty. »
Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Open your hearts to us. We have not harmed anyone. We have not corrupted anyone. We didn't take advantage of anyone.
I do not say this to condemn you, for I have already said that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.
Great is the boldness of my words towards you. Great is my boasting in your favor. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
For when we entered Macedonia, our flesh was not relieved, but we were afflicted on all sides. The fighting was outside. Fear was within.
However, he who comforts the humble, God, has consoled us by the coming of Titus,
and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation he received in you, when he told us of your desire, your mourning, and your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more.
For if I have saddened you with my letter, I do not regret it, although I have regretted it. For I see that my letter has saddened you, though only for a time.
I rejoice now, not that you have been sorrowful, but that you have been sorrowful unto repentance. For you have been piously afflicted, that you may suffer no loss through us.
For pious sorrow produces repentance which leads to salvation, which entails no regret. But the sadness of the world produces death.
For behold, this same thing, that you have been afflicted in a pious manner, what earnest care it has produced in you. Yes, what a defence, what indignation, what fear, what desire, what zeal, what demand! In all, you have shown yourselves to be pure in this matter.
Therefore, if I have written to you, it is not for the cause of him who has done evil, nor for the cause of him who has suffered evil, but that the solicitude you have shown towards us may be revealed in you before God.
That is why we have been consoled. In our consolation, we rejoiced all the more in the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by all of you.
For if in any way I have boasted to him in your favor, I have not been disappointed. But as we have told you all things in truth, so our glorification which I have done before Titus has been found to be the truth.
His affection is more abundant towards you, while he remembers all your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.
I am glad that I am confident in you in everything.
Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which has been bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia,
how, in a severe trial of distress, the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded even to the richness of their generosity.
For, according to their power, I testify, yes, and beyond their power, they have given of their own accord,
begging us with great insistence to receive this grace and communion in the service of the saints.
It didn't happen as we had planned, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.
We have therefore exhorted Titus to complete this grace in you, as he had begun it before.
Now, as you abound in all things, in faith, in word, in knowledge, in all that is serious, and in your love for us, let you also abound in this grace.
I do not speak as a commandment, but as a proof, by the seriousness of others, of the sincerity of your love.
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, though rich, became poor for your sake, that you might become rich through his poverty.
Here is the advice I give you: it is opportune that you, who were the first to begin a year ago, not only do, but also have the will.
But now, finish also doing, so that, as there was the will to do, there may also be completion according to your ability.
Indeed, if the eagerness is there, it is according to what you have, and not according to what you do not have.
For it is not that others may be relieved and you afflicted,
but for there to be equality. For the abundance which you have at this moment fills their lack, so that their abundance may also fill your lack, and there may be equality.
As it is written, "He who hoarded much lacked nothing, and he who amassed little lacked nothing."
But thanks be to God, who puts in the heart of Titus the same zeal for you.
Indeed, he welcomed our exhortation, but being very serious himself, he went to you of his own accord.
We have sent with him the brother whose praise of the Good News is known in all the congregations.
Not only this, but he has also been appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our eagerness.
We avoid this, so that no one will blame us for this abundance that is administered by us.
Having regard to honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the eyes of men.
We have sent with them our brother, whose seriousness we have often proved in many things, but who is even more so now, because of the great confidence he has in you.
As for Titus, he is my partner and my work companion for you. As for our brethren, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.
Therefore testify to your love for them before the assemblies, and to our boasting on your behalf.
For it is useless for me to write to you about the service of the saints,
for I know your eagerness, of which I boast in your name to those of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year. Your zeal has given rise to a very large number of them.
But I have sent the brethren that our boasting in your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, so that, as I have said, you may be prepared,
lest if any one from Macedonia comes with me and finds you unprepared, we (not to mention you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.
I therefore thought it necessary to pray to the brethren to precede you and to arrange in advance the generous gift which you had previously promised, so that this gift might be ready out of generosity and not out of greed.
Know that he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows abundantly will also reap abundantly.
Let each one give according to what he has decided in his heart, without reluctance or constraint, for God loves the one who gives with joy.
And God can make you abound in all graces, so that, always having all sufficiency in all things, you may abound for every good work.
As it is written, "He scattered the people. He gave to the poor. His justice remains forever. »
Now let him who furnishes seed for the sower and bread for food, furnish and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,
enriching you in everything for all the generosity that produces thanksgiving to God through us.
For the liberality which you discharge not only fills the gaps among the saints, but also abounds in thanksgiving to God,
for, by the proof it brings, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ and for the generosity of your contribution to them and to all,
while they themselves, in supplication to you, aspire to you because of the immense grace of God in you.
Thanks be to God for his ineffable gift!
Now I, Paul, beseech you by the humility and meekness of Christ, I who, in your presence, am humble among you, but who, in your absence, am bold towards you.
Yes, I beg you to see to it that, when I am present, I do not show courage with the boldness with which I intend to be emboldened against some, who consider that we walk according to the flesh.
For although we walk according to the flesh, we do not fight according to the flesh;
for the weapons of our battle are not those of the flesh, but they are powerful before God to overthrow the strongholds,
to overthrow imaginations and every loftiness that rises up against the knowledge of God, and to bring every captive thought to the obedience of Christ,
being ready to avenge every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
Do you look at things only as they appear before you? If anyone believes in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider again in himself that, as he is Christ's, we also are Christ's.
For if I boast a little of our authority, which the Lord has given to edify you and not to bring you down, I will not be ashamed,
so that it does not seem that I wish to frighten you by my letters.
For, they say, "his letters have weight and force, but his bodily presence is weak, and his word is despised."
Let such a person consider this: what we are in word by letter when we are absent, we are also in deed when we are present.
For we dare not number ourselves or compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves against themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
But we will not boast beyond the proper limits, but within the limits which God has assigned to us, and which extend to you.
For we do not dwell too far, as if we had not reached you. Indeed, we have come to you with the Good News of Christ,
without boasting too much of the work of others, but hoping that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,
in order to preach the Good News to the regions beyond you, without boasting of what another has already done.
But "he who glorifies himself may glory in the Lord."
For it is not he who boasts that is approved, but he whom the Lord boasts.
I would like you to put up with me with a little madness, but you put up with me.
For I am jealous of you with a pious jealousy. For I have promised you in marriage to one spouse, that I might present you to Christ as a pure virgin.
But I fear that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, so your minds will be corrupted by the simplicity that is in Christ.
For if the one who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit which you have not received, or another "good news" which you have not accepted, you will be very happy with it.
Because I believe that I am not at all behind the best apostles.
If I am not very gifted for speech, I am not so for knowledge. No, in every way, we have been revealed to you in all things.
Or have I committed a sin in humbling myself to exalt you, because I have freely preached to you the Good News of God?
I have despoiled other assemblies, taking their wages to serve you.
When I was present among you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brethren who came from Macedonia provided for the measure of my need. In all things, I have taken care not to be a burden to you, and I will continue to do so.
As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will prevent me from boasting thus in the regions of Achaia.
What for? Because I don't like you? God knows.
But what I am doing, I will continue to do, in order to cut off the opportunity of those who desire an opportunity, so that, in what they boast, they may be recognized as we are.
For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as the apostles of Christ.
And this is not surprising, because even Satan pretends to be an angel of light.
It is therefore no great thing if his servants also pretend to be servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.
I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But if this is the case, receive me as a fool, so that I too may glory a little.
What I say I do not say according to the Lord, but as folly, in this assurance of boasting.
Since many glory according to the flesh, I will also boast.
For you willingly bear with fools, being wise.
For you endure the man who enslaves you, who devours you, who takes you captive, who exalts himself, who hits you in the face.
To my great shame, I speak as if we had been weak. But in whatever way someone is bold (I am talking like a fool), so am I.
Are they Hebrews? Me too. Are they Israelites? I am too. Are they the descendants of Abraham? Me too.
Are they servants of Christ? (I am more so: more work, more prisons, more beatings, and more deaths.
Five times, I received forty lashes from the Jews with a stick minus one.
Three times, I was beaten with rods. Once, I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I spent a night and a day in the depths.
I have often been on a journey, in the perils of rivers, in the perils of robbers, in the perils of my countrymen, in the perils of the heathen, in the perils of the city, in the perils of the desert, in the perils of the sea, in the perils of false brethren;
in work and work, in frequent vigils, in hunger and thirst, in frequent fasting, in cold and nakedness.
Besides these external things, there is what presses me every day: anxiety for all the assemblies.
Who is weak, and I am not? Who is led to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?
If I must boast, I will glory in what concerns my weakness.
The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, the one who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
At Damascus, the governor of King Aretas, who guarded the city, wanted to arrest me.
I was made to go down into a basket through a window near the wall, and I escaped from his hands.
It is probably not useful for me to boast, but I will have visions and revelations of the Lord.
I know a man in Christ who was caught up to the third heaven fourteen years ago – whether in the body, I don't know, or out of the body, I don't know; God knows.
I know such a man (whether he is in the body, or out of the body, I do not know; God knows),
I will glory in behalf of such a man, but I will not glory in my name, except in my weaknesses.
For if I wanted to boast, I would not be stupid, for I would tell the truth. But I abstain, so that no one thinks of me anything other than what he sees in me or hears of me.
Because of the immensity of the revelations, so that I might not be exalted beyond measure, a thorn in the flesh was given to me: a messenger of Satan to torment me, so that I would not be exalted beyond measure.
About this thing, I have begged the Lord three times that it will depart from me.
He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is fulfilled in weakness." Therefore I prefer to glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
Therefore I delight in weaknesses, wounds, necessities, persecutions, and distresses, for Christ's sake. Because it's when I'm weak that I'm strong.
I went crazy bragging. You have constrained me, for it is you who ought to have recommended me, for I am in no way inferior to the best apostles, although I am nothing.
For the signs of an apostle were wrought among you with perseverance, by signs, wonders, and miracles.
For in what way have you been made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, except that I myself have not been a burden to you? Forgive me for this fault!
Behold, this is the third time that I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek your goods, but you. Because it is not the children who should save for the parents, but the parents for the children.
I will spend and will be spent very willingly for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I less loved?
Even so, I have not burdened you myself. But you could say that being cunning, I have taken you by cunning.
Have I profited by you through any of those whom I have sent you?
I exhorted Titus, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Were we not walking in the same spirit? Have we not followed in the same footsteps?
Again, do you think we apologize to you? It is before God that we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edification.
For I fear that perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you as I wish, and that I shall be found by you as you do not desire, that perhaps there will be quarrels, jealousies, fits of anger, factions, calumnies, murmurings, proud thoughts, or riots,
that again, when I come, my God will humble me before you, and I will mourn many who have sinned before, and who have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and lust they have committed.
This is the third time I have come to you. "Every word shall be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses."
I have warned before, and I warn again, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned before and to all others that, if I return, I will not spare them,
since you are looking for a proof of Christ who speaks in me, who is not weak, but who is powerful in you.
For he was crucified by weakness, but he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves, to know if you are in the faith. Examine yourself. Or do you not know, as far as your own person is concerned, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless you are disqualified.
But I hope you know that we are not disqualified.
Now, I pray God that you do not do evil; not that we appear to be approved, but that you do what is honourable, although we seem to have failed.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. We also pray for this: that you may become perfect.
Therefore I write these things in my absence, that I may not be too severe in my presence, according to the authority which the Lord has given me to edify, and not to demolish.
Finally, brothers, rejoice! Be perfect. Be comforted. Have the same spirit. Live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints greet you.
Paul, the apostle, not from men and by men, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,
and all the brethren who are with me, at the assemblies of Galatia.
Grace and peace be to you from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
who gave himself up for our sins, that he might deliver us from the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father,
to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
I wonder that you are so quick to abandon the one who called you in the grace of Christ for another "good news."
But there is no other "good news". Only, there are people who trouble you and who want to pervert the Good News of Christ.
But if we ourselves, or an angel from heaven, announce to you any other "good news" than the one we have announced to you, let him be cursed.
What we have already said, I repeat now: if anyone tells you any other "good news" than the one you have received, let him be cursed.
For do I now seek the favor of men, or that of God? Or am I trying to please men? For if I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.
But I let you know, brethren, concerning the Good News which has been preached by me, that it is not according to man.
For I did not receive it from a man, nor was it taught to me, but it came to me by revelation from Jesus Christ.
For you have heard how I once lived in the religion of the Jews, and how I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.
I was more advanced in the Jewish religion than many of my countrymen of my age, being more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
But when God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, had the good pleasure
to reveal his Son in me, that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately converse with flesh and blood,
and I did not go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went to Arabia. Then I went back to Damascus.
Then, at the end of three years, I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and I stayed with him fifteen days.
But of the other apostles I have seen only James, the brother of the Lord.
Now, as for the things I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.
Then I arrived in the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
I was still unknown in face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,
but they only heard it said, "He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once strove to destroy."
So they glorified God in me.
Then, after a period of fourteen years, I went back to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me as well.
I ascended by revelation, and I set forth before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, lest I run, or have run, in vain.
But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, being a Greek.
It was because of the false brethren who had been secretly introduced, who had entered to spy on the liberty we have in Christ Jesus, in order to reduce us to servitude,
and to whom we have not given way in the way of submission, not even for an hour, so that the truth of the Good News may be maintained among you.
But of those who had the reputation of being important - whoever they were, it makes no difference to me; God does not differentiate between men. Those, I say, who were respected, communicated nothing to me,
but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised,
for he who acted through Peter in the apostleship to the circumcised, also acted through me to the Gentiles,
and when they saw the grace that had been given me, James, Cephas, and John, the reputed pillars, gave Barnabas and me the right hand of communion, that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.
They only asked us to remember the poor, which I also did with zeal.
But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he was condemned.
Indeed, before people came from James, he ate with the pagans. But when they came, he withdrew and stood aside, fearing those who were of circumcision.
And the other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that Barnabas himself allowed himself to be carried away by their hypocrisy.
Seeing that they did not walk upright according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter, in the presence of all, "If you, who are a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, why do you force the Gentiles to live like the Jews?
We, who are Jews by nature and not sinful pagans,
yet knowing that it is not by the works of the law that man is justified, but by faith in Jesus Christ, we also believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, for no flesh shall be justified by the works of the law.
But if, while we were seeking justification in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!
For if I rebuild what I have destroyed, I myself am a transgressor of the law.
For by the law I have died to the law, that I might live for God.
I was crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. The life I now lead in the flesh I lead by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me.
I do not reject the grace of God. For if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing! »
Foolish Galatians, who bewitched you so that you would not obey the truth, and before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly presented in your midst as crucified?
I want to learn this from you: Have you received the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Are you so foolish? After beginning in the Spirit, are you now finished in the flesh?
Have you suffered so many things in vain, if it is in vain?
Whosoever furnishes you with the Spirit, and works miracles in your midst, does he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
In the same way, Abraham "believed in God, and this was counted to him for righteousness."
Know therefore that those who have faith are children of Abraham.
The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, announced the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you all nations shall be blessed."
So then, those who have faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
For all those who practice the works of the law are under the curse. For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not do all that is written in the book of the law."
Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for it is written, "The righteous shall live by faith."
The law is not of faith, but, "The man who does them shall live by them."
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written: "Cursed is everyone who hangs from a tree."
that the blessing of Abraham may come upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we may receive by faith the promise of the Spirit.
Brethren, in human terms, although it is only a covenant of man, when it has been confirmed, no one cancels it or adds to it.
Now the promises were made to Abraham and his descendants. He does not say, "To one offspring, as to many, but as to one, 'To your descendants,' which is Christ."
Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul it, so as to render the promise ineffective.
For if the inheritance comes from the law, it no longer comes from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham by promise.
So why does the law exist? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed to whom the promise was made came. It was ordained by angels, by the hand of a mediator.
Now, there is no mediator between the one and the other, but God is one.
Is the law, then, against God's promises? Certainly not! For if there had been given a law that could give life, most certainly justice would have been of the law.
But Scripture has imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, locked up for the faith that was to be revealed next.
So that the law became our preceptor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
For you are all children of God, through faith in Jesus Christ.
For all of you who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or freeman, there is no longer male or female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
If you belong to Christ, then you are the seed of Abraham and the heirs according to the promise.
But I say that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he is the master of everything,
but he is under the guardianship and stewardship until the day fixed by the father.
Thus, we too, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world.
But when the time was fulfilled, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might be adopted as children.
And because you are children, God has sent into your hearts the Spirit of his Son, who cries out, "Abba, Father!"
Thus you are no longer slaves, but sons; and if you are a son, you are heirs of God through Christ.
But at that time, not knowing God, you were enslaved to those who, by nature, are not gods.
But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you return to the elementary, weak and miserable principles to which you want to be enslaved again?
You observe the days, months, seasons, and years.
I fear for you that I have wasted my work for you.
I beg you, brothers, become like me, for I too have become like you. You have done me no wrong,
but you know that it was because of my weakness in the flesh that I preached the Good News to you the first time.
What was a temptation to you in my flesh, you have neither despised nor rejected; but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
What was the blessing you received? For I testify to you that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
Have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
They do not zealously seek you out with good intentions. No, they want to take you away, so that you will look for them.
But it is always good to be zealous for a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.
My little children, for whom I am still in labor until Christ is formed in you -
But I would like to be present with you now, and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.
Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, the other by the free woman.
Now the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, but the son of the free woman was born by promise.
These things contain an allegory, for they are two covenants. One is that of Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.
For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage with her children.
But the Jerusalem above is free, it is the mother of us all.
For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who do not give birth. Go out and shout, you who are not working. For the desolate woman has more children than the one who has a husband. »
We, brethren, are, like Isaac, children of promise.
But just as then he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.
Now, what does Scripture say? "Drive out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free woman."
Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the handmaid, but of the free woman.
Stand firm therefore in the freedom by which Christ has freed us, and do not allow yourselves to be caught again under the yoke of servitude.
Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you.
Yes, I also testify to every man who receives circumcision that he is indebted to the whole law.
You are strangers to Christ, you who want to be justified by the law. You have fallen from grace.
For we, by the Spirit, wait by faith for the hope of righteousness.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision have any value, but faith acting through charity.
You were running well! Who has meddled with you so that you do not obey the truth?
This persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
A little yeast grows throughout the mass.
I trust in you, in the Lord, that you will not think otherwise. But whoever troubles you will pass judgment, whatever it may be.
But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross was removed.
I would like those who disturb you to cut themselves off.
For you, brethren, have been called to freedom. Only, do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but, out of love, be servants of one another.
For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you do not consume one another.
But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
For the flesh has desires contrary to those of the Spirit, and the Spirit to those of the flesh; and these desires are contrary to each other, so that you do not do what you will.
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
Now the deeds of the flesh are manifest, they are adultery, fornication, impurity, lust,
idolatry, magic, hatred, quarrels, jealousies, outbursts, rivalries, divisions, heresies,
envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and the like; of which I warn you, as I have also warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, benevolence, faith,
gentleness and self-control. Against such things, there is no law.
Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.
If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
Let's not get big-headed, let's not provoke each other, let's not envy each other.
Brethren, if a man is found to be at fault, you who are spiritual, restore him in a spirit of meekness, taking heed of yourselves, so that you too may not be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and thus you will fulfill the law of Christ.
For if someone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deceiving himself.
Let each one examine his own work, and he will have reason to glory in himself, and not in another.
For each one will bear his own burden.
But let him who is instructed by the word share all good things with him who teaches.
Make no mistake. God is not mocked, for what man sows, he will also reap.
For he who sows for his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh. But he who sows for the Spirit will reap eternal life through the Spirit.
Let us not tire of doing good, for we will reap in due time, if we do not grow weary.
Therefore, according to the opportunity given us, let us do good to all men, and especially to those in the house of faith.
See with what large letters I write to you in my own hand.
All those who want to make a good impression in the flesh require you to be circumcised, so that you will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
For the circumcised themselves do not keep the law, but they want to have you circumcised, so that they may glory in your flesh.
But far be it from me to glory in it, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world was crucified for me, and I for the world.
For in Jesus Christ there is no longer circumcision or uncircumcision, but a new creation.
All who walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
From now on, let no one make any difficulty for me, for I bear on my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, my brethren. Amen.
Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and to the faithful in Jesus Christ:
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,
as he chose us in himself before the foundation of the world, that we might be holy and without blemish before him in love,
having predestined us to adoption as children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,
to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he has freely favored us in the Beloved.
In him we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace
whom he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and prudence,
by making known to us the mystery of his will, according to the good pleasure which he willed in him,
until the administration of the fulness of times, to sum up in him all things in Christ, those which are in heaven and those which are on earth.
We have also received an inheritance in him, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who does all things according to the counsel of his will,
that we may be to the praise of his glory, we who had previously hoped in Christ.
In him you also, after hearing the word of truth, the Good News of your salvation, and having believed, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
which is the pledge of our inheritance, for the redemption of the property of God, to the praise of his glory.
Therefore I also, having learned faith in the Lord Jesus who is among you, and the love you have for all the saints,
I do not cease to give thanks for you, mentioning you in my prayers,
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in his knowledge,
enlightening the eyes of your hearts, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
and what is the immensity of his power towards us who believe, according to the operation of the force of his power
which he worked in Christ by raising him from the dead and making him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,
far above all dominion, all authority, all power, all power, and all name that is named, not only in this century, but also in the one to come.
He has subdued all things under his feet, and has made him head of all things for the Church,
which is his body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
You became alive, when you were dead in your transgressions and in your sins,
in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience.
We too all once lived among them in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the intellect, and we were by nature children of wrath, like the others.
But God, rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he has loved us,
when we were dead by our trespasses, made us alive with Christ – by grace you were saved –
he raised us up with him, and made us sit with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
in order to show in the ages to come the immense richness of his grace in goodness to us in Jesus Christ;
For by grace you were saved, through faith, and it is not from you; it is the gift of God,
and not of works, so that no one may boast.
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has prepared beforehand, that we may do them.
Remember, then, that in the past you, pagans in the flesh, called uncircumcised by what is called circumcision (in the flesh, made with hands),
you were at that time separated from Christ, strangers to the community of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, without hope and without God in the world.
But now, in Christ Jesus, you who were once far away, have become near through the blood of Christ.
For it is he who is our peace, who has made one and the other one being, and who has broken down the wall of separation,
having abolished in his flesh enmity, the law of the commandments contained in the ordinances, in order to create in himself one new man from the two, making peace,
and to reconcile them both in one body with God by the cross, having by it killed enmity.
He has come to proclaim peace to you who are far away and to those who are near.
For it is through him that we have access to the Father in one Spirit.
Therefore you are no longer strangers and people of the land, but you are fellow-citizens of the saints and of the house of God.
being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone,
in whom the whole edifice, adjusting itself to one another, rises to form a holy temple in the Lord,
in whom you are also built up to be a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
Therefore I, Paul, am the prisoner of Jesus Christ in your behalf, you Gentiles,
if you have heard of the administration of the grace of God which has been given to me towards you,
how, by revelation, the mystery was revealed to me, as I have written before in a few words,
by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,
who, in other generations, has not been revealed to the children of men, as he has now been to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,
namely, that the Gentiles are joint-heirs and joint-heirs of the body, and that they have a share in its promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,
of whom I have been made a servant according to the gift of the grace of God which has been granted to me according to the operation of his power.
To me, the least of all the saints, was given this grace to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,
and to make known to all the administration of the mystery hidden for centuries in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ,
so that now, through the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God may be revealed to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places,
according to the eternal purpose which he has accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
In Him, we have assurance and trusting access through our faith in Him.
Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart because of my sorrows for you, who are your glory.
Therefore I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name,
that he may grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inward person,
that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that, rooted and founded in love,
you may be strengthened to understand with all the saints what is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth,
and to know the love of Christ, which surpasses all knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
Now, to him who can do infinitely more than all that we ask or think, according to the power that acts in us,
to him be glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus, for all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
I, therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk in a manner worthy of the call to which you have been called,
in all humility, with patience, bearing with one another in charity,
striving to preserve the unity of the Spirit by the bond of peace.
There is one body and one Spirit, as also you have been called in one hope of your calling,
one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
one God and Father of all, who is above all, through all and in all of us.
But to each one of us, grace has been given according to the measure of Christ's gift.
That is why he says, "When he ascended into heaven, he led captivity into captivity, and gave gifts to the people."
Now, this sentence, "He ascended," what does it mean, if not that He first descended into the depths of the earth?
He who came down is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, in order to fill all things.
He gave some as apostles, others as prophets, others as evangelists, others as shepherds and teachers;
for the perfecting of the saints for the work of service, for the building up of the body of Christ,
until we have all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to the state of a complete man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,
so that we may no longer be children, tossed about and carried away by every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by artifices, according to the ways of error;
but that, speaking the truth in charity, we may grow in all things towards him who is the head, Christ,
from which the whole body, adjusted and welded together by what each joint furnishes, according to the work in measure of each individual part, makes the body grow for its edification in charity.
Therefore I say and testify in the Lord that you no longer walk like the rest of the Gentiles, in the futility of their thoughts,
being obscured in their understanding, far from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their hearts.
Having become insensitive, they gave themselves up to covetousness, to commit all kinds of impurities with greed.
But this is not how you learned Christ,
if you have heard him and have been instructed in him, as the truth is in Jesus:
that you get rid of the old man who corrupts himself according to the lusts of deceit as far as your old way of life is concerned,
that you may be renewed in the spirit of your understanding,
and that you put on the new man, who, in the likeness of God, was created in the righteousness and holiness of truth.
Therefore, renouncing lies, speak the truth to each other, for we are members of one another.
"Be angry, and sin not." Don't let the sun set on your anger,
and do not give in to the devil.
Let him who flew no longer steal; but let him rather work, producing with his hands something good, that he may have something to give to him who is in need.
Let no corrupt speech come out of your mouth, but only that which is good for edifying others according to need, so that it may be gracious to those who hear.
Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in which you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness, all wrath, all anger, all protest and all calumny be removed from you, with all malice.
And be kind to one another, with a tender heart, forgiving one another, as God also in Christ has forgiven you.
Be imitators, therefore, of God, as beloved children.
Walk in love, as Christ also loved us and gave himself up for us, as an offering and a sacrifice to God, in a sweet-smelling perfume.
But sexual immorality, and all impurity or lust, let not be mentioned among you, as befits saints;
nor defilements, nor foolish words, nor jests, which are not proper, but rather thanksgiving.
Know for sure that no sexually immoral person, no impure person, no greedy man (who is an idolater), has an inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.
Let no one deceive you with vain words, for it is because of these things that the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience.
Therefore have no part with them.
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk like children of light,
for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, in all righteousness, and in truth,
proving what is pleasing to the Lord.
Do not commune with the fruitless actions of darkness, but rather reprove them.
For it is a shame to talk about the things they do in secret.
But all things, when they are reprobated, are revealed by light, for everything that reveals is light.
Therefore he says, "Awake, you who sleep, and rise from the dead, and Christ will shine upon you."
Take heed therefore in the manner in which you walk, not as imprudent, but as wise,
by redeeming time, for the days are bad.
Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what is the will of the Lord.
Do not let yourselves be intoxicated by wine, which is a source of dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,
speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making your hearts sound to the Lord,
always giving thanks to God the Father for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ.
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the assembly, being himself the saviour of the body.
Now, as the congregation is subject to Christ, so wives must be subject to their husbands in all things.
Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,
in order to sanctify it, after having purified it by bathing it with water with the word,
to present to himself the glorious Church, without spot, wrinkle, or anything of the kind, but holy and without blemish.
Similarly, husbands must love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.
For no man has ever hated his own flesh, but feeds and cherishes it, as the Lord also does for the congregation,
because we are members of his body, flesh and bones.
"Therefore a man will leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife. Then the two will become one flesh. »
This mystery is great, but I speak about Christ and the congregation.
Nevertheless, let each of you love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
"Honor your father and your mother," which is the first commandment with a promise:
"That you may be happy and live long on earth."
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
Servants, be obedient to those who, according to the flesh, are your masters, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your hearts, as to Christ,
not by serving only when the eyes are on you, as pleasure-seekers, but as servants of Christ, doing with all your heart the will of God,
of good will, rendering service to the Lord and not to men,
knowing that, whatever good each one does, he will again receive the same good from the Lord, whether bound or free.
You, masters, do the same with regard to them, and renounce the threat, knowing that he who is both their master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality in him.
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his power.
Put on all the armor of God, that you may be able to resist the wiles of the devil.
For it is not against flesh and blood that we are fighting, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the world, against the darkness of this world, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
Wherefore, clothe yourselves with all the armor of God, that ye may be able to resist the evil day, and, after having done all, to stand firm.
Stand then, having fastened the girdle of truth at your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness,
Having shod your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace,
and above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the fiery darts of the evil one.
And take up the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;
making all kinds of prayers and petitions, praying at all times by the Spirit, and watching for this end in all perseverance and making requests for all the saints.
Pray for me, that it may be given to me to open my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the Good News,
of which I am the ambassador in chains, that I may speak boldly, as I ought to do.
But that you may also know how I am, Tychicus, beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make all things known to you.
It is for this purpose that I have sent it to you, that you may know our state and that it may comfort your hearts.
Peace be with the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
May grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love. Amen.
Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and servants:
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I give thanks to my God every time I remember you,
always in all the requests that I make on behalf of you all, presenting them with joy,
for the collaboration you have given in the proclamation of the Good News from the first day until now,
knowing that he who has begun a good work in you will finish it until the day of Jesus Christ.
It is even right that I should think thus in favor of all of you, for I carry you in my heart, since, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all share in grace with me.
For God is my witness that I desire you all in the tender mercies of Jesus Christ.
I beg you to make your love increase more and more in knowledge and discernment,
that you may approve of good things, that you may be sincere and blameless in the day of Christ,
being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
Now, brethren, I want you to know that what has happened to me has rather contributed to the progress of the Good News,
so that it became evident to all the guard of the palace and to all others that my bonds are in Christ,
and that most of the brethren in the Lord, trusting because of my bonds, have more audacity to proclaim the word of God without fear.
For there are some who preach Christ even out of envy and quarrel, and others also out of good will.
The former preach Christ without conviction, out of ambition, thinking that they add sorrow to my chains;
but the latter, out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
What does that matter? Only that in every way, whether in appearance or in truth, Christ be proclaimed. I am delighted with it, yes, and I will rejoice.
For I know that through your prayers and the bringing of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, it will result in my salvation,
according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall not be disappointed in the least, but that in all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, either by life or by death.
For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is to gain.
But if I live in the flesh, it will yield the fruit of my labor; but I don't know what I will choose.
But I am torn between the two, having the desire to leave and be with Christ, which is much better.
But it is more necessary, for your sake, to remain in the flesh.
Having this assurance, I know that I will remain, yes, and that I will remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,
so that your boasting may abound in Jesus Christ in me, through my coming presence among you.
Only, let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, so that, whether I come to see you or I am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one mind, with one soul, striving for the faith of the Good News;
and in no way frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but for you of salvation, and that from God.
For it has been granted to you, in the name of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer in his name,
by having the same conflict that you saw in me and now hear it in me.
If, then, there be any exhortation in Christ, any consolation of love, any fellowship of the Spirit, any tenderness and compassion,
fill my joy by being animated by the same feelings, the same love, the same agreement, the same thought;
doing nothing out of rivalry or vanity, but with humility, each one counting the others better than himself;
each of you not only looking at your own things, but also at those of others.
Have this thought within you, which was also that of Jesus Christ,
who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as a thing to be grasped,
but stripped himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.
And having been found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, yes, the death of the cross.
Therefore God has exalted him supremely and given him the name which is above every name,
so that at the name of Jesus every knee may bow in heaven, on earth and under the earth,
and let every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work for your own salvation with fear and trembling.
For it is God who acts in you, both to will and to do, according to his good pleasure.
Do all things without complaining and without arguing,
that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, in the midst of which you are seen as lights in the world,
upholding the word of life, that I might boast in the day of Christ that I had not run in vain or labored in vain.
Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am happy and rejoice with you all.
In the same way, you also rejoice and rejoice with me.
But I hope in the Lord Jesus that he will soon send you Timothy, so that I too may be comforted when I know how you are.
Because I don't have anyone else who has the same feelings as me and who is really interested in you.
For all seek their own interests, and not those of Jesus Christ.
But you know that it has proven itself. As a child serves his father, he has served with me to advance the Good News.
That's why I hope to send it right away, as soon as I see how it goes for me.
But I trust in the Lord, for I too will come soon.
But I have deemed it necessary to send you Epaphroditus, my brother, my fellow worker, my comrade-in-arms, your apostle, and my servant in need,
for he desired you all, and he was very anxious because you had heard that he was ill.
For he was sick almost to death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him, but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
I have therefore sent it with all the more diligence because, when you see it again, you will rejoice and I will be less sad.
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men,
for, for the work of Christ, he came close to death, at the risk of his life, to make up for what was lacking in your service to me.
Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord! Writing the same things to you, to me certainly is not tiring, but for you it is certain.
Beware of dogs, beware of bad workmen, beware of false circumcision.
For we are the circumcision, who worship God by the Spirit, who rejoice in Christ Jesus, and who have no trust in the flesh,
even if I had confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks they trust in the flesh, I even more:
circumcised on the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews, Pharisee as to the law,
persecutor of the Church as far as zeal is concerned, irreproachable as regards the justice of the law.
However, I consider the things that have been acquired for me to be a loss to Christ.
Yes, assuredly, and I regard everything as a loss, because of the excellence of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them only as waste, in order to gain Christ
and to be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that of the law, but that which comes from faith in Christ, the righteousness that comes from God by faith,
that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death,
if I can, by any means, attain to the resurrection of the dead.
Not that I have already obtained, or that I am already perfect; but I persevere, in order to grasp what I have been seized by Jesus Christ.
Brethren, I do not yet consider myself to have gained a foothold, but I do know one thing: forgetting what is behind and clinging to what is ahead,
I strive to attain the goal for the prize of God's high calling in Jesus Christ.
Let us therefore think thus, all of us who are perfect. If, in anything, you think otherwise, God will reveal it to you too.
Nevertheless, insofar as we have already arrived, let us proceed according to the same rule. Let us have the same spirit.
Brethren, be imitators of me together, and observe those who walk in this way, as you have us for an example.
For many walk, of whom I have often spoken to you, and of whom I speak to you now weeping, like the enemies of the cross of Christ,
whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who think of earthly things.
For our city is in heaven, from which we also look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,
who will transform the body of our humiliation to make it conform to the body of his glory, according to the operation by which he can even subjugate all things to himself.
Wherefore, my brethren, beloved and desired, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.
I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same in the Lord.
Yes, I beg you also, faithful partner, help these women, for they have worked with me in the Good News, with Clement too, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
Rejoice in the Lord always! I will also say: "Rejoice!"
Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.
Do not worry about anything, but in all things, by prayer and request, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.
And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
Finally, brethren, all that is true, all that is honorable, all that is just, all that is pure, all that is beautiful, all that is of good repute, if there is any virtue and if there is anything worthy of praise, think of these things.
Do what you have learned, received, heard, and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.
But I rejoice greatly in the Lord that now at last you have revived your thoughts for me, which you were indeed thinking of, but you lacked the opportunity.
Not that I speak for lack of it, for I have learned, in whatever state I may be, to be content with it.
I know how to be humiliated, and I also know how to abound. In every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being full and hungry, of being in abundance and of being in need.
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
Now you have done well to share my affliction.
You yourselves know, Philippians, that at the beginning of the Good News, when I left Macedonia, no congregation participated with me in the giving and reception, except you.
For, even in Thessaloniki, you have always met my needs.
Not that I am looking for the gift, but I am looking for the fruit that increases on your account.
But I have everything and I abound. I am satisfied, having received from Epaphroditus that which comes from thee, a pleasant odor, a pleasing and satisfying sacrifice unto God.
My God will provide for all your needs, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
To our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever! Amen.
Greet every saint in Jesus Christ. The brothers who are with me greet you.
All the saints greet you, especially those who are of the house of Caesar.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy, our brother,
To the holy and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colossae: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you,
having heard of your faith in Jesus Christ and of the love you have for all the saints,
because of the hope that is reserved for you in heaven, and of which you have heard before in the word of truth of the Good News
which has come to you, as it is in all the world, and bears fruit and grows, as it also grows in you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in the truth,
as you have learned from Epaphras, our beloved companion in service, faithful servant of Christ on your behalf,
who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
Wherefore, we also, from the day we learned, have not ceased to pray and ask for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in every respect, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God,
strengthened with all might, according to the power of his glory, for all endurance and perseverance in joy,
giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled us to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light,
who delivered us from the power of darkness and carried us into the kingdom of the Son of his love,
in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins.
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
For by him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible things and invisible things, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers. All things were created by him and for him.
He is before all things, and all things subsist in him.
He is the head of the body, of the assembly, he who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, in order to have pre-eminence in all things.
For it pleased all the fullness to dwell in him,
and to reconcile all things to Himself through him, both those on earth and those in heaven, having established peace through the blood of his cross.
You who were once alienated and enemies in your minds by your evil deeds,
He has now reconciled you by death in the body of his flesh, in order to present you holy, blameless, and without blemish before him,
if at least you persevere in the faith, grounded and unshakeable, without turning away from the hope of the Good News which you have heard and which is proclaimed in all creation under heaven, of which I, Paul, have been made servants.
Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and I make up for what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for the sake of his body, which is the congregation,
of whom I have been made a servant according to the office of God entrusted to me to you for the fulfillment of the word of God,
a mystery hidden for centuries and generations. But now he has been revealed to his saints,
to whom God has willed to make known what is the richness of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
We proclaim it, exhorting every man and instructing him in all wisdom, that we may make every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
This is what I also strive to do, according to his operation which acts powerfully in me.
For I want you to know how much I strive for you, for those of Laodicea, and for all those who have not seen my face in the flesh;
that their hearts may be comforted, that they may be united in charity, and that they may acquire all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, to know the mystery of God, of the Father, and of Christ,
in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Now, I say this so that no one can deceive you with persuasive speeches.
For, though I am absent in the flesh, I am with you in the spirit, rejoicing, and seeing your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
Therefore, as you have received the Lord Jesus Christ, walk in him,
rooted and edified in him, and established in the faith, as you have learned, by giving thanks to it.
Take heed that no one robs you by his philosophy and vain deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.
For in him dwells bodily all the fullness of the divinity,
and in him you are filled, he who is the head of all principality and power.
In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision that was not done with hands, in the stripping of the body from the sins of the flesh, according to the circumcision of Christ,
having been buried with him in baptism, in which you also rose with him by faith in the action of God, who raised him from the dead.
You were dead by your sins and by the uncircumcision of your flesh. He has made you live with him, forgiving us all our trespasses,
by erasing the writing of the ordinances that was against us. He took her from the way, nailing her to the cross.
Having despoiled the principalities and powers, he openly made a spectacle of them, thereby triumphing over them.
Let no one judge you, therefore, in regard to eating or drinking, or in regard to a feast day, a new moon, or a Sabbath day,
who are a shadow of things to come; but the body is Christ's.
Let no one rob you of your prize by humbling himself and prostrating himself before the angels, by clinging to what he has not seen, by vainly puffing himself up with a carnal spirit,
and by not attaching himself firmly to the head, from which the whole body, nourished and united by the joints and ligaments, grows according to the growth of God.
If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit to ordinances,
"Do not touch, nor taste, nor touch"
(which all perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?
For these things have the appearance of wisdom in self-imposed worship, in humility, and in severity toward the body, but they have no value against the complacency of the flesh.
If, therefore, you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above, where is Christ, seated at the right hand of God.
Fix your thoughts on the things above, and not on those that are on earth.
For you are dead, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ, our life, appears, you will also appear with him in glory.
Therefore put to death your members who are on earth: sexual immorality, impurity, depraved passion, evil desire, greed, which is idolatry.
It is because of these things that the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience.
You also walked in these things in the past, when you lived in these things,
but now you must cast them all away: anger, anger, malice, calumny, and the shameful words that come out of your mouth.
Do not lie to one another, since you have stripped the old man and his deeds,
and that you have put on the new man, who is renewed in knowledge, in the image of his Creator,
where there is neither Greek nor Jew, neither circumcised nor uncircumcised, neither barbarian nor Scythian, neither slave nor free, but where Christ is all and in all.
Clothe yourselves, therefore, as God's elect, holy and beloved, with a heart of compassion, goodness, modesty, humility, and perseverance;
bear with one another, and forgive one another, if anyone has anything to reproach himself with; as Christ has forgiven you, do it too.
Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.
And may the peace of God reign in your hearts, to which you have also been called in one body, and be thankful.
Let the word of Christ dwell richly in you; in all wisdom, teach and exhort one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing to the Lord with grace in your hearts.
Whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God the Father.
Wives, be subject to your husbands, as befits the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives, and do not be bitter against them.
Children, obey your parents in all things, for it pleases the Lord.
Fathers, do not provoke your children, so that they may not be discouraged.
Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not only when they look, as if to please men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.
And whatever you do, work with a good heart, as for the Lord and not for men,
knowing that you will receive from the Lord the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
But he who does evil will receive again for the evil he has done, and there is no partiality.
Masters, give to your servants what is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
Persevere in prayer, watching over it with thanksgiving,
praying together for us too, so that God may open a door for us to speak, to proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds,
so that I may reveal it as I must say.
Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming time.
Let your discourse always be full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer each one.
All my affairs will be communicated to you by Tychicus, beloved brother, faithful servant and companion in service in the Lord.
For this purpose I am sending him to you, that he may know your situation and console your hearts,
with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will let you know everything that is going on here.
Aristarchus, my companion in captivity, greets you, as well as Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, of whom you have been told: "If he comes to you, receive him."
and Jesus, who is called Justus. These are my only fellow laborers for the kingdom of God, who are circumcision, and who have been of great comfort to me.
Epaphras , who is one of yours , servant of Christ , greets you , always striving to support you in his prayers , that you may be perfect and complete in all the will of God .
For I testify to him that he has great zeal for you, for those of Laodicea and for those of Hierapolis.
Luke, the beloved physician, and Démas greet you.
Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, with Nymphas, and the congregation that is in his house.
When this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans, and let you also read the letter from Laodicea.
Say to Archippus, "Take heed of the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it."
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians, in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We always give thanks to God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers,
remembering unceasingly your work of faith, your work of love, and your perseverance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.
We know, brothers loved by God, that you are the elect,
and that our Good News has come to you not only in words, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and with great boldness. You know what sort of men we have shown ourselves in your midst because of you.
You have become imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in great affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,
so that you have become an example to all who believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
For it is through you that the word of the Lord has been proclaimed, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place where your faith in God has spread, so that we have nothing to say.
For they themselves relate to us what reception we have received from you, and how you have been converted from idols to God to serve a living and true God,
and to wait from heaven for his Son, whom he raised from the dead: Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
As you yourselves, brethren, know that the visit we have made to you has not been in vain,
but, having suffered before and having been shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we have emboldened ourselves in our God to preach to you the Good News of God, in a great conflict.
For our exhortation is not made in error, nor in impurity, nor in deceit.
But just as we have been accepted by God to be charged with the Good News, so we speak, not to please men, but to God, who tests our hearts.
For it has never happened to us to use flattering words, as you know, nor a mantle of lust (God is witness),
nor to seek the glory of men (neither of you nor of others), when we could have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.
But we have been gentle in your midst, like a mother who suckles her children.
Therefore, ardently desiring you, we wanted to communicate to you, not only the Good News of God, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us.
You remember, brothers, our work and our pain; for, working night and day, that we may not be a burden to any of you, we have preached to you the Good News of God.
You are witnesses before God of the holiness, justice, and blamelessness with which we have conducted ourselves toward you who believe.
You know, we have exhorted, consoled and begged each one of you, as a father does for his children,
that you may walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you to his kingdom and glory.
For this reason we also give thanks to God unceasingly for the fact that, when you received from us the word of God's message, you received it not as the word of men, but as the truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.
For you, brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also have suffered the same things at the hands of your countrymen, as they have done at the hands of the Jews
who have killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and who have cast us out, and who are not pleasing to God, and who are contrary to all men,
preventing us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved, so that they may always fulfill their sins. But the anger came on them to the extreme.
But we, brethren, deprived of you for a short time, in the presence and not in the heart, have endeavored to see your face with great desire,
for we wanted to come to you, I, Paul, once and again, but Satan prevented us.
For what is our hope, or our joy, or our crown of rejoicing? Is it not you, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
For you are our glory and our joy.
That is why, unable to bear it any longer, we thought it best to remain alone in Athens,
and we have sent Timothy, our brother and servant of God in the Good News of Christ, to strengthen and comfort you about your faith,
so that no one may be moved by these afflictions. Because you know that we have been appointed for this task.
For when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were going to suffer affliction, as it happened, and you know it.
Therefore I also, when I could not bear it any longer, sent to know your faith, lest by any means the tempter should tempt you, and our work should be in vain.
But Timothy has just arrived from you, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love, and that you always have a good memory of us, desiring to see us, as we also desire to see you.
Wherefore, brethren, we have been comforted by you in all our distress and affliction, by your faith.
For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
What thanksgiving can we give to God again for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake before our God,
By praying night and day insistently to see your face and to perfect what is lacking in your faith?
May our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our steps to you.
May the Lord make you grow and abound in love for one another and for all men, as we also do for you,
that he may establish your blameless hearts in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
Finally, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, so that, as you have received from us the way in which you should walk and please God, you may abound more and more.
For you know what instructions we have given you through the Lord Jesus.
For this is the will of God: your sanctification, by abstaining from all immorality,
so that each one of you may know how to dispose of his body in sanctification and honor,
and not in the passion of lust, like the pagans who do not know God,
so that no one may abuse or injure a brother or sister in this matter; for the Lord is the avenger in all these things, as we have also announced and testified to you.
For God has not called us to impurity, but to sanctification.
Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given you his Holy Spirit.
But as for brotherly love, you don't need to be written to. For you yourselves are instructed by God to love one another,
which you do to all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, to abound more and more,
and to apply yourselves to leading a quiet life, to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we have taught you,
so that you may behave well towards those outside and have need of nothing.
But we do not want you, brethren, to be ignorant about those who have fallen asleep, so that you may not grieve like others, who have no hope.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so God will bring back with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.
For we say to you according to the word of the Lord, we who are alive, who remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud cry, at the voice of the archangel and at the sound of the trumpet of God. The dead in Christ will rise first,
then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.
Console one another, therefore, with these words.
But as for the times and seasons, brothers, you do not need to be written to you.
For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.
For when they say, "Peace and security," a sudden ruin will surprise them, like the pains of childbirth for a pregnant woman. And they will have no chance of escaping.
But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that the day may overtake you like a thief.
You are all children of light and children of the day. We belong neither to the night nor to the darkness.
Let us not sleep, therefore, like the others, but let us watch and be sober.
For those who sleep sleep in the night, and those who are drunk get drunk in the night.
But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and charity, and the hope of salvation as our helmet.
For God has not ordained us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
who died for us, so that, awake or asleep, we might live together with him.
Therefore exhort one another, and edify one another, as you also do.
But we beseech you, brethren, to know those who work among you, who are above you in the Lord, and who warn you,
and to respect and honor them with love because of their work. Be at peace with each other.
We exhort you, brethren: Warn the disorderly; encourage the faint-hearted; support the weak; Be patient with everyone.
See to it that no one returns evil for evil, but always seek what is good for the other and for all.
Always rejoice.
Pray without ceasing.
In all things, give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
Do not quench the Spirit.
Do not despise prophecies.
Put everything to the test, and hold fast to what is good.
Abstain from all forms of evil.
May the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely. May your whole mind, soul, and body be preserved unblemished at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Whoever calls you is faithful, he will do it too.
Brethren, pray for us.
Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
I solemnly command thee by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brethren.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians, in God our Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as is fitting, because your faith grows more and more, and the love of each and every one of you for one another abounds.
so that we boast of you in the assemblies of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions you endure.
This is a clear sign of God's righteous judgment, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer.
For it is right that God should repay affliction to those who afflict you,
and may he relieve you, who are afflicted with us, when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven with his mighty angels in a blazing fire,
to punish those who do not know God and those who do not obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus,
who will pay the price: the eternal destruction of the face of the Lord and the glory of his power,
when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints and to be admired by all who believe, because our testimony to you has been believed.
Therefore we also always pray for you, that our God may judge you worthy of your vocation, and that he may accomplish with power every desire for goodness and every work of faith,
that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering to him, we ask you
not to be speedily shaken in your mind, nor troubled, either by a spirit, or by a word, or by a letter, as coming from us, saying that the day of Christ has already arrived.
Let no one deceive you in any way. For this will not happen, unless rebellion comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction.
He opposes and rises up against everything that is called God or that which is worshipped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God.
Do you not remember that when I was still with you, I told you these things?
You now know what is holding him back, so that he may reveal himself in his own time.
For the mystery of iniquity is already at work. Only, there is one who holds back now, until he is taken out of the way.
Then the ungodly will appear, whom the Lord will put to death by the breath of his mouth, and whom he will destroy by the manifestation of his coming,
the one whose advent is in accordance with the work of Satan, with all mightiness, lying signs and wonders,
and with all the seductions of wickedness to those who are lost, because they have not received the love of the truth, that they may be saved.
Because of this, God sends them a powerful illusion, so that they believe in falsehood,
so that all those who have not believed in the truth, but have taken pleasure in injustice, may be judged.
But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, beloved brethren of the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through the sanctification of the Spirit and faith in the truth.
to whom he has called you by our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, brethren, stand firm and preserve the traditions which we have taught you, either by word or by letter.
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who has loved us and given us by grace eternal consolation and good hope,
comfort your hearts and strengthen you in all good works and words.
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread quickly and be glorified, as also among you,
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith.
But the Lord is faithful, he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one.
We trust in the Lord in you, for you do and will do what we command you.
May the Lord direct your hearts in the love of God and in the perseverance of Christ.
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brethren who walk in rebellion and not according to the tradition which they have received from us.
For you know how you must imitate us. For we have not behaved among you in a rebellious way,
and we have not eaten bread out of anyone's hand without paying for it, but we have worked night and day with labor and toil, so that we may not be a burden to any of you.
It is not that we have no right to do so, but it is to serve as an example for you, so that you may imitate us.
In fact, when we were with you, we had already given you this order: "If anyone does not want to work, let him not eat".
For we have heard of some who walk among you in revolt, who do not work at all, but who occupy themselves.
Now we ordain and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ those who are in this way, that they may work quietly and eat their own bread.
But you, brethren, do not tire of doing what is right.
If anyone does not obey what we have said in this letter, note him and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.
Do not consider him an enemy, but exhort him as a brother.
Now, may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all.
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter. This is how I write.
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the command of God our Saviour and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,
to Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
As I begged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus, that you may command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,
and not to cling to endless myths and genealogies, which provoke disputes rather than to the stewardship of God, who is in the faith.
Now, the purpose of this commandment is love coming from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.
things from which some, having missed the goal, have turned away to give themselves up to vain speeches,
who want to be doctors of the law, although they understand neither what they say nor what they forcefully affirm.
But we know that the law is good, if someone makes legitimate use of it,
knowing that the law was not made for the righteous, but for the ungodly and the insubordinate, for the ungodly and the sinners, for the ungodly and the profane, for the murderers of fathers and the murderers of mothers, for the murderers of men,
for fornicators, for homosexuals, for slaveholders, for liars, for perjurers, and for anything else contrary to sound doctrine,
according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which has been entrusted to me.
I give thanks to him who made me capable, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he numbered me among the faithful, by appointing me to the service,
although I was once a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent. But I have obtained mercy, because I have acted out of ignorance, in unbelief.
The grace of our Lord abounded all the more through the faith and charity that is in Christ Jesus.
The word is faithful and worthy of being received, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the first.
But that is why I have obtained mercy, so that in me first Jesus Christ may display all his patience to serve as an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life.
Now, to the eternal, immortal, invisible King, to God who alone is wise, honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
I entrust this instruction to you, my son Timothy, according to the prophecies that have been given to you before, so that by them you may fight the good fight,
by keeping the faith and the good conscience, which some have rejected and who have been shipwrecked in the faith,
among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan to teach them not to blaspheme.
I therefore exhort, first of all, to make requests, prayers, intercessions and thanksgiving for all men,
for kings and for all those who hold high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and respect.
For this is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,
who wants all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.
For there is but one God and one mediator between God and men, Jesus Christ, man,
who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time,
for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle - I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie - an educator of the Gentiles in the faith and the truth.
I therefore desire that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger and without doubt.
In the same way, let women adorn themselves with decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive garments,
but with good works, which is suitable for women who profess piety.
Let the woman learn calmly, with complete submission.
But I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but let her be silent.
For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.
Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, fell into disobedience;
but she will be saved by childbirth, if she perseveres in faith, charity, and holiness with sobriety.
This saying is true: he who seeks to be an overseer desires a good deed.
The overseer must therefore be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, temperate, reasonable, modest, hospitable, knowing how to teach;
not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy;
knowing how to govern his own house well, subduing children in all reverence;
(For how could someone who does not know how to govern his own house take care of God's assembly?
and not a new convert, lest puffed up with pride he should fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
He must also have a good testimony from those outside, so as not to fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
In the same way, servants must be respectful, not have a sharp tongue, not be given to wine, not be greedy for money,
to keep the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.
Let them also be tried first, and then let them serve, if they are blameless.
Likewise, their wives must be respectful, not backbiting, temperate, and faithful in all things.
Let the servants be husbands of one wife, let them manage their children and their own household well.
For those who have served well acquire a good reputation and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you soon,
but if I delay, it is that you may know how to conduct oneself in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and foundation of truth.
Without dispute, the mystery of piety is great: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed in the world, and received in glory.
But the Spirit expressly says that in the course of time some will forsake the faith, clinging to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons.
by the hypocrisy of men who tell lies, branded with a hot iron in their own conscience,
forbidding marriage and commanding abstaining from the foods that God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if he is received with thanksgiving.
For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
If you instruct your brethren in these things, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith and the good doctrine which you have followed.
But refuse profane fables and those of old women. Train yourself in piety.
For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the present life and the life to come.
This word is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.
For it is to this end that we labor and suffer reproach, because we have put our trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of those who believe.
Command and teach these things.
Let no one despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.
While waiting for me to come, devote yourselves to reading, exhortation, and teaching.
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, and which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of hands of the elders.
Attend to these things. Give yourself entirely to them, so that your progress may be revealed to all.
Take care of yourself and your teaching. Persevere in these things, for in this way you will save yourself and those who listen to you.
Do not rebuke an old man, but exhort him like a father; young men as brothers;
older women as mothers; young women as sisters, in all purity.
Honor widows who are truly widows.
But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety to their own family and to reciprocate their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.
She who is a widow and desolate puts her hope in God and perseveres night and day in supplications and prayers.
But she who gives herself up to pleasure is dead during her life.
Order these things also, that they may be blameless.
But if someone does not provide for his needs, and especially those of his family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
That no one be registered as a widow under sixty years of age, having been the wife of one man,
approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has practiced every good work.
But refuse young widows, for when they have debauched themselves against Christ, they desire to marry,
by being condemned, because they rejected their first engagement.
In addition, they also learn to be idle, going from house to house. Not only are they idle, but they are also talkative and busy, saying things that they should not say.
I therefore want young widows to marry, to have children, to run the house, and not to give the adversary the opportunity to insult.
For already some have turned away after Satan.
If a man or woman who believes has widows, let him relieve them, and let not the assembly be overwhelmed, so that it may relieve those who are truly widows.
Let the elders who govern well be considered worthy of a double honor, especially those who labor in speech and teaching.
For the Scripture says, "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when it treads the grain." And: "The worker deserves his wages."
Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except on the word of two or three witnesses.
Those who have sinned, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that others also may be in fear.
I command you, under the gaze of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, to observe these things without prejudice, without partiality.
Don't lay hands on anyone in a hurry. Do not participate in the sins of others. Stay pure.
No longer be a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for the good of your stomach and your frequent infirmities.
The sins of some men are evident, they precede them at the judgment, and others also follow later.
Similarly, there are good works that are obvious, and others that cannot be hidden.
Let all those who are slaves under the yoke consider their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the doctrine may not be blasphemed.
As for those who have believing teachers, let them not despise them because they are brothers, but let them serve them, because those who share in the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
If anyone teaches any other doctrine and does not conform to the sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine that is suitable for godliness,
he is a vain man, who knows nothing, but who is obsessed with discussions, disputes and quarrels over words, from which come envy, quarrels, insults, bad suspicions,
the constant friction of people with corrupt minds and devoid of truth, who think that piety is a means of gain. Remove yourself from such people.
But piety with contentment is a great gain.
For we have brought nothing into the world, and we certainly cannot take anything away.
But if we have food and clothing, we will be satisfied with them.
But those who want to get rich fall into temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and perdition.
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. Some have gone astray from the faith by their greed, and have pierced themselves with many sorrows.
But you, man of God, flee from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and meekness.
Fight the good fight of faith. Grasp the eternal life to which you have been called, and you have confessed the right confession before many witnesses.
I command you, before God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who bore witness to good confession before Pontius Pilate,
to keep the commandment spotless, without reproach, until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ,
whom he will show at the proper time, he who is the blessed and only head, the king of kings and the lord of lords.
He alone has immortality, dwelling in an inaccessible light, which no man has seen or can see, to whom belong honor and eternal power. Amen.
Ask those who are rich in the present age not to be puffed up with pride, and not to base their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who provides us with abundance all that we can enjoy;
that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, that they are willing to share;
that they may form a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life.
Timothy, keep what has been entrusted to you, turning away from the vain speeches and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge,
some of whom professed , and who have thus strayed from the faith . Grace be with you. Amen.
Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
I give thanks to God, whom I serve as my ancestors, with a pure conscience. As I remember you unceasingly in my requests, night and day
desiring to see you, remembering your tears, that I might be filled with joy;
having remembered the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am convinced, in you too.
That is why I remind you that you must stimulate the gift of God that is in you by the laying on of my hands.
For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.
Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner, but endure suffering for the Good News, according to the power of God,
who saved us and called us by a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace, which were granted to us in Christ Jesus before eternal time,
but which have now been revealed by the appearance of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.
For this reason I was appointed preacher, apostle, and teacher of the Gentiles.
That's why I also suffer these things. But I am not ashamed, for I know the one in whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to keep what I have entrusted to him for that day.
Keep the pattern of the sound words you have heard from me, in the faith and charity that is in Christ Jesus.
This good that has been entrusted to you, guard it by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
You know that all those who are in Asia have turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
May the Lord have mercy on the house of Onesiphorus, for he has often refreshed me, and has not been ashamed of my chain,
but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me
(may the Lord grant him to find the Lord's mercy in this day); and in how many things he served Ephesus, you know very well.
You, therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
What you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust it to faithful men, who are able to instruct others also.
So you must endure trials like a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
No soldier on duty meddles in the affairs of life, in order to please the one who has enlisted him as a soldier.
Similarly, if someone participates in an athletics competition, he is not crowned if he did not compete according to the rules.
The working farmer must be the first to receive a share of the crops.
Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.
Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the seed of David, according to my Good News,
in which I suffer privations until I am chained like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained.
Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
These words are worthy of belief: "For if we died with him, we will also live with him.
If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.
If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful; because he cannot deny himself. »
Remind them of these things, recommending them, before the Lord, not to discuss the words unnecessarily, to the detriment of those who hear.
Strive to present yourself before God, as a workman who has nothing to be ashamed of, carefully handling the Word of Truth.
But flee from empty speeches, for they go further in impiety,
and these speeches are consumed like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
men who have gone astray in the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overturning the faith of some.
However, the solid foundation of God remains, having this seal: "The Lord knoweth them that are his" and "Whosoever calls on the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."
In a large house, there are not only vases of gold and silver, but also vases of wood and clay. Some are for honor, others for dishonor.
If, therefore, anyone purifies himself from these, he will be a vessel of honor, sanctified, fit for the use of the master, prepared for every good work.
Flee from the lusts of youth, but seek justice, faith, love and peace with those who call on the Lord with a pure heart.
But refuse foolish and ignorant questions, knowing that they give rise to quarrels.
The servant of the Lord must not quarrel, but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,
gently correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God will give them a repentance that will bring them to the full knowledge of the truth,
and they will recover from the devil's snare, after having been taken away by him to do his will.
But know that, in the last days, difficult times will come.
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, rebels against their parents, ungrateful, impious,
without natural affection, pitiless, slanderers, incapable of self-control, ferocious, not loving the good,
traitors, stubborn, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than God,
having an appearance of piety, but denying his power. Turn away from these also.
For there are among them people who break into the houses and take credulous women prisoners, laden with sins, carried away by various lusts,
who learn incessantly and never attain to the knowledge of the truth.
As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these oppose the truth, men of corrupt minds, who are rejected as far as faith is concerned.
But they will not go any further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs has been also.
But you have followed my teaching, my conduct, my resolution, my faith, my patience, my love, my firmness,
my persecutions and sufferings, those which have befallen me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra. I endured these persecutions. The Lord has delivered me from all .
Yes, and all those who want to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
But the wicked and the impostors will go further and further, deceiving and being deceived.
But you, you remain in the things which you have learned and of which you have been assured, knowing from whom you have learned them.
From childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures which can make you wise for salvation through the faith that is in Jesus Christ.
All Scripture is inspired of God and useful for teaching, for convicting, for correcting, and for instructing in righteousness,
so that every man who belongs to God may be complete, perfectly equipped for every good work.
I command you, therefore, before God and before the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his coming and in his kingdom:
preach the word; be pressing in season and out of season; rebuke, rebuke, exhort, with all the patience and instruction required.
For the time will come when men will not listen to sound doctrine, but will itch to hear, and gather teachers according to their own desires,
will turn their ears away from the truth and turn to fables.
But you, be sober in all things, suffer privations, do the work of an evangelist, and carry out your ministry.
For I am already offered, and the time for my departure has arrived.
I fought the good fight. I completed the course. I have kept the faith.
From now on, I reserve for myself the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those who loved his appearance.
Be diligent to come and see me soon,
for Demas left me, having loved the present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens, in Galatia; and Titus, in Dalmatia.
Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.
But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
Bring to Carpus, when you come, the cloak which I left at Troas, and the books, especially the parchments.
Alexander, the coppersmith, has done me a lot of harm. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
Beware of him, for he has been very opposed to our words.
During my first defense, no one came to help me, but all abandoned me. Let them not be reproached for this.
But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and all the Gentiles might hear it. Thus I was delivered from the lion's mouth.
And the Lord will deliver me from all evil works and keep me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus ill at Miletus.
Take care to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as well as Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.
The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
Paul, servant of God and apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the knowledge of the truth that befits godliness,
in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the beginning of time,
but who in his time revealed his word in the message with which I was charged, according to the command of God our Saviour,
to Titus, my true child, according to a common faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
For this reason I have left you in Crete, that you may put in order what is lacking, and that you may appoint elders in every city, as I have commanded you,
if anyone is blameless, husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of having a wanton or undisciplined conduct.
For the overseer must be irreproachable, like God's steward, not indulge in self-satisfaction, not easily irritated, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain,
but let him practice hospitality, let him love the good, let him have a sober mind, let him be just, let him be holy, let him be master of himself,
let him stick to the faithful word, conformable to the teaching, in order to be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince those who contradict him.
For there are also many turbulent men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of circumcision,
whose mouths must be shut: men who overturn whole houses, teaching things they ought not, for dishonest gain.
One of them, a prophet of theirs, said, "The Cretans are always liars, wicked beasts, and idle gluttons."
This testimony is true. Wherefore, rebuke them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,
without paying attention to Jewish fables and the commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
To those who are pure, all is pure, but to those who are unclean and unbelieving, nothing is pure; their minds and consciences are defiled.
They profess that they know God, but they deny Him by their deeds, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
But say the things that are suitable to sound doctrine,
namely, that old men should be temperate, reasonable, sober of spirit, solid in faith, in charity and in perseverance,
and that old women should likewise have a respectful conduct, be neither backbiters nor slaves of wine, teachers of what is good,
so that they may teach young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be sober of spirit, chaste, hard-working in the home, amiable, submissive to their husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed.
In the same way, exhort young men to be sober of mind.
In all things, set yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,
and with a sound and blameless word, so that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us.
Exhort the servants to be submissive to their masters and to be pleasing in all things, without contradicting,
without stealing, but showing all good faithfulness, in order to adorn in all things the doctrine of God, our Saviour.
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
instructing ourselves that, renouncing impiety and worldly lusts, we may live soberly, justly, and devoutly in the present world,
while waiting for the blessed hope and the appearance of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
who gave himself for us, in order to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own, zealous for good works.
Say these things, exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.
Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for any good work,
not to speak ill of anyone, not to be quarrelsome, to be gentle, showing all humility towards all men.
For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.
But when the goodness of God our Saviour and his love for men appeared,
not by works of righteousness that we ourselves have done, but according to his mercy, he has saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
that he has poured out upon us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
so that, justified by his grace, we may be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
This word is true, and I desire that you should insist on these things with boldness, that those who have believed in God may take care to preserve good works. These things are good and profitable to men;
but avoid foolish questions, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about the law, for they are useless and vain.
Avoid a factious man, after a first and a second warning,
knowing that such a man is perverted and sinful, and that he condemns himself.
When I send you Artema or Tychicus, take care to come and join me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Send Zenas the jurist and Apollos quickly, so that they may lack nothing.
Let our people also learn to maintain good works to provide for the necessary needs, so that they may not be fruitless.
All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy, our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow laborer,
to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our comrade-in-arms, and to the assembly that is in your house:
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I always give thanks to my God, by mentioning you in my prayers,
hearing of your love and faith in the Lord Jesus and in all the saints,
so that the communion of your faith may become efficacious in the knowledge of all the good that is in us in Christ Jesus.
For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
Wherefore, though I have in Christ all the boldness to command you what is proper,
I prefer, out of love, to appeal to you, being such a Paul, old, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my chains,
which formerly was useless to you, and which is now useful to you and to me.
I send it back to you. Receive it, therefore, that is to say, my own heart,
which I have wished to keep with me, so that it may serve in my favor in my chains for the Good News.
But I would do nothing without your consent, so that your goodness might not be as a necessity, but as a free will.
Wherefore, perhaps, he was separated from you for a time, that you might possess him forever,
no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, for me especially, but how much more for you, in the flesh and in the Lord.
If, therefore, you consider me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
But if he has wronged you or if he owes you something, put it on my account.
I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay you (without telling you that you also owe me your own person).
Yes, brother, let me rejoice in you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.
Trusting in your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will even do more than I say.
Prepare also a bed and breakfast for me, for I hope that, thanks to your prayers, I can be restored to you.
Epaphras, my companion in captivity in Jesus Christ, greets you,
as well as Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
God, having formerly spoken to the fathers at various times and in various ways through the prophets,
spoke to us, at the end of these days, through his Son, whom he made heir of all things, by whom he also created the worlds.
His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and he sustains all things by the word of his power; After He had cleansed us of Himself from our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty of heaven,
having become as superior to the angels as the more excellent name which he has inherited is superior to theirs.
For to whom of the angels has he ever said, "You are my son. Today, I have become your father? And again, "I will be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to me?" »
When he again introduced the firstborn into the world, he said, "Let all the angels of God bow down to him."
Of the angels, he says, "He makes winds to his angels, and his servants a flame of fire."
But he says of the Son, "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever. The scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your Kingdom.
You loved righteousness and hated iniquity; That is why God your God has anointed you with an oil of jubilation above your fellow men. »
And, "You, Lord, in the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth. The heavens are the work of your hands.
They will perish, but you continue. They will all age like a garment.
You shall wrap them up like a cloak, and they shall be changed; but you're the same. Your years will not be missed. »
But which of the angels said at some point, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?"
Are they not all servant spirits, sent to serve those who are to inherit salvation?
Therefore we must be more attentive to the things we have heard, lest we go astray.
For if the word spoken by the angels has proved to be unshakable, and if every transgression and disobedience has received a just punishment,
how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which, first announced by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard it?
God by bearing witness with them, by signs and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
For he did not subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.
But somebody testified somewhere, saying, "What is man, that you should think of him? Or the son of man, that you may care for him?
You made it a little lower than the angels. You have crowned him with glory and honor.
You have subdued everything under his feet. For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing that is not subject to him. Now we do not yet see all things that are subject to him.
But we see him who was made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the sufferings of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that, by the grace of God, he might taste death for all.
For it pleased Him, for whom all things are and through whom all things are, by bringing many children to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation by sufferings.
For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one, and therefore he is not ashamed to call them brothers,
saying, "I will declare your name to my brethren. In the midst of the assembly, I will sing your praises. »
Again: "I will trust him." And again: "Here I am with the children that God has given me."
Since the children had a share in flesh and blood, he himself had a share in the same thing, so that by death he might annihilate him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
and that he delivers all those who, through the fear of death, have been all their lives enslaved.
For it is not to the angels that he comes to the aid, but to the seed of Abraham.
Therefore he was obliged in all things to be made like his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things of God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
For having himself suffered to be tempted, he is able to succor those who are tempted.
Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus,
who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house.
For he was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, since he who built the house has more honor than the house.
For every house is built by someone; but he who built everything is God.
Moses was faithful in all his house, as a servant, to bear witness to the things that were to be said later;
but Christ is faithful as a Son to his house. We are his house, if we hold fast to our confidence and the glory of our hope to the end.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you would hear his voice,
Do not harden your hearts as in rebellion, in the day of trial in the wilderness,
where your fathers tested and tried me, and saw my deeds for forty years.
That's why I was dissatisfied with this generation, and said, "They always err in their hearts," but they didn't know my methods.
As I swore in my anger, "They shall not enter into my rest."
Beware, brethren, that there is not in one of you an evil and unbelieving heart that departs from the living God;
but exhort one another, day by day, as long as it is called "today," so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast to the end the beginning of our trust,
while it is said, "Today, if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in rebellion."
For who, when they heard, rebelled? Were they not all those who had come out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?
With whom was he discontented for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned and whose bodies fell into the desert?
To whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest, but to those who disobeyed?
We see that they were not able to enter because of their unbelief.
Let us therefore fear that any one of you will appear to have broken the promise to enter into his rest.
For the good news has been preached to us, as to them also; but the word which they heard did not profit them, because it was not mixed with faith by those who heard it.
But we, who have believed, enter into this rest, as he said, "As I have sworn in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest," although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
For he has said somewhere concerning the seventh day, "God rested on the seventh day from all his works";
and again here: "They will not enter into my rest."
Since, therefore, there remain that some enter into it, and those to whom the good news was previously preached have not entered it because of their disobedience,
he again defines a certain day, "today," saying by David so long afterwards (as has been said), "Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken of another day afterwards.
So there remains a Sabbath rest for God's people.
For he who has entered into his rest has also rested from his works, as God has done from his.
Let us therefore strive to enter into this rest, lest anyone fall into the same example of disobedience.
For the word of God is living and effective, sharper than any two-edged sword, it penetrates to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrows, and it is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give an account.
Having therefore a high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, hold fast to our confession.
For we have not a high priest who cannot be touched by the sense of our infirmities, but one who has been tempted like us in all things, but without sinning.
Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to be helped in times of need.
For every high priest, taken from among men, is appointed for men in things concerning God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
The high priest can treat with gentleness those who are ignorant and misguided, because he himself is surrounded by weakness.
Therefore he must offer sacrifices for the sins of the people, as well as for himself.
No one takes this honor upon himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron.
In the same way, Christ did not boast of being made high priest, but it was he who said to him, "You are my son. Today, I have become your father. »
As he also says in another place, "You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
He, in the days of his flesh, having addressed with loud cries and tears, prayers and supplications to him who could save him from death, and having been heard because of his pious fear,
although he was a Son, he nevertheless learned obedience by the things he suffered.
Having been perfected, he became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him.
and he was appointed by God high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Concerning him, we have many words to say, and difficult to interpret, since you have become deaf.
For, although you are now teachers, you still need to be taught the rudiments of the first principles of God's revelations. You need milk, not solid food.
For he who lives on milk has no experience of the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.
But solid food is for those who have grown up, and who, by use, have their senses trained to discern good and evil.
Therefore, leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let us strive for perfection, laying anew the foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith in God,
of the teaching of baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
This is what we will do, God permitting.
For as for those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
who have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
and who afterwards fell, it is impossible to bring them back to repentance, since they crucify the Son of God again for themselves and expose him to ignominy.
For the land that has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and that produces a suitable harvest for those for whom it is also cultivated, receives the blessing of God;
but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nearly cursed, its end being to be burned.
But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and of things that go with salvation, although we speak thus.
For God is not unjust, so much so as to forget your work and the work of love which you have shown towards his name, in that you have served the saints, and are still serving them.
We desire that each of you show the same eagerness until the end of the fullness of hope,
so that you may not be lazy, but imitators of those who, by faith and perseverance, have inherited the promises.
For when God made a promise to Abraham, as he could not swear by anyone greater, he swore by himself,
saying, "I will bless you, and I will multiply you."
Thus it was that, having borne patiently, he obtained the promise.
Men, in fact, swear by a greater one, and in any dispute on their part, the oath is final for confirmation.
Thus it is that God, desiring to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed himself by an oath,
so that, by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to find refuge may be strongly encouraged to grasp the hope that is set before us.
This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope at once sure and unshakeable, and which penetrates into that which is beyond the veil,
where Jesus entered for us as a forerunner, having become high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
For that Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham on his return from the slaughter of kings, and blessed him,
to whom Abraham also shared the tenth part of everything (being first, by interpretation, "king of righteousness", then also "king of Salem", which means "king of peace",
without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest in perpetuity.
Now consider the greatness of this man, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave tithes on the best booty.
For those of the sons of Levi who receive the office of priest have been commanded to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, although they have come out of the body of Abraham.
but he whose genealogy is not numbered from them has accepted the tithe of Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.
The smaller is blessed by the greatest, without any dispute.
Here people who die receive tithes, but there someone receives tithes from the one who is attested to be living.
We can say that, through Abraham, even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes,
for he was still in his father's body when Melchizedek met him.
Now, if perfection was obtained by the Levitical priesthood (for it was under it that the people received the law), what need was there that another priest should arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?
For the priesthood being changed, it is necessary that the law should also be changed.
For the one here spoken of belongs to another tribe, whose altar no one has taken care of.
For it is evident that our Lord is descended from Judah, a tribe of which Moses did not speak concerning the priesthood.
What is even more obvious is that, like Melchizedek, there is another priest,
who was created, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life;
for it is testified, "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."
For there is a nullification of a previous commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
(for the law has not perfected anything), and the introduction of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.
In fact, he was not established as a priest without an oath
(for they were made priests without oath), but he was ordained priest with oath by him who said of him, "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
In this way, Jesus became the guarantee of a better covenant.
For many have been priests, because death prevented them from continuing.
But he, because he lives eternally, has an immutable priesthood.
Therefore he can also save to the extreme those who draw near to God through him, since he lives eternally to intercede for them.
For it is such a high priest who is befitting us, holy, innocent, spotless, separate from sinners, exalted above heaven,
who does not need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices every day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people. For he did it once and for all, by offering himself.
For the law appoints as high priests men who have a weakness, but the word of the oath, which is subsequent to the law, establishes forever a Son who has been perfected.
Now, in what we say, the essential thing is this: we have such a high priest, who has sat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
servant of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord has set up, and not a man.
For every high priest is called to offer gifts and sacrifices. It is therefore necessary that this high priest also has something to offer.
For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law,
which serve as a copy and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned by God when he was going to build the tabernacle, for he said, "Behold, you shall do all things according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."
But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which, on better promises, has been given as law.
For if this first alliance had been without defect, no attempt would have been made to establish a second.
For when he found them at fault, he said, "Behold, the days are coming," says the Lord, "that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
not according to the covenant I made with their fathers on the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they have not persevered in my covenant, and I have neglected them," says the Lord.
"For this is the covenant which I shall make with the house of Israel after those days," says the Lord: "I will put my laws in their spirits; I will also write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
They will not teach every man his fellow citizen and every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord." for all will know me, from the least to the greatest.
For I will be merciful to their iniquity. I will remember no more their sins and their unlawful deeds. »
By saying, "A new covenant," he has rendered the first one null and void. But what becomes obsolete and ages is close to disappearing.
Now, even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service and an earthly sanctuary.
In fact, a tabernacle had been prepared. In the first part were the candlestick, the table and the shewbread, which is called the holy place.
After the second veil, there was the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,
with a golden altar for incense, and the ark of the covenant, covered with gold on all sides, in which were a golden vessel containing manna, the staff of Aaron that had grown, and the tablets of the covenant;
and above them, cherubim of glory, which overshadowed the mercy seat, of which we cannot now speak in detail.
These things being thus prepared, the priests continually enter into the first tabernacle, performing the services,
but in the second, the high priest alone, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people.
The Holy Spirit thus indicates that access to the holy place has not yet been revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing.
It is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are incapable, so far as conscience is concerned, of making the worshipper perfect,
being only carnal ordinances (with food and drink and various purifications), imposed until a time of reform.
But Christ, having come as high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, which is not made with hands, that is, which is not of this creation,
nor again by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, entered once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.
For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer that sprinkles those who have defiled themselves, sanctify for the purity of the flesh,
how much more will the blood of Christ, who, by the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has come for the redemption of the transgressions committed under the first covenant, so that those who have been called may receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance.
For where there is a last will and testament, it is necessary that the one who made it should be dead.
For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force as long as the one who made it lives.
That is why even the first covenant was not consecrated without blood.
For when Moses had spoken all the commandments of the law to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the book himself and all the people,
saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you."
He sprinkled blood in the same way on the tabernacle and all the utensils of the ministry.
According to the law, almost everything is purified with blood, and without bloodshed, there is no remission.
It was therefore necessary that the copies of the things that are in the heavens should be purified by these, but that the heavenly things themselves should be purified by sacrifices better than these.
For Christ did not enter the holy places made with hands, which are representations of the truth, but into heaven itself, in order to appear now for us in the presence of God.
Nor must he have offered himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place every year with a blood that is not his own.
Otherwise, he would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now, once, at the end of the ages, he was revealed to blot out sin by his own sacrifice.
As it is foreseen that men die once and after that there is judgment,
so Christ, after having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to take upon himself sin, but to save those who are impatiently waiting for him.
For the law, which is but a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of these goods, can never, with the same sacrifices that are offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.
Or would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, once purified, would no longer have been conscious of their sins?
But in these sacrifices, there is an annual remembrance of sins.
For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
That is why, when he comes into the world, he says, "You have not desired a sacrifice and an offering, but you have prepared a body for me.
You did not love whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
And I said, "Behold, I have come" (it is written of me in the scroll of the book). to do your will, O God. »
Having said before, "You did not desire sacrifices and offerings, whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, nor did you take pleasure in them" (those offered according to the law),
then he said, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He removes the former, in order to establish the latter,
by which we have been sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.
For every priest stands every day to serve and offer often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
But he, after having offered forever one sacrifice for sins, sat down at the right hand of God.
Since then, he has been waiting for his enemies to become the footstool of his feet.
For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.
The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after having said,
"This is the covenant that I will make with them. after those days," says the Lord, "I will put my laws on their hearts, I will write them also on their minds;" then he says,
"I will remember their sins and iniquities no more."
But where there is remission, there is no longer an offering for sin.
Having therefore, brethren, the boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus,
by the way he has made for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is, his flesh,
and having a high priest over the house of God,
let us approach with a sincere heart, in the fullness of faith, with our hearts purified from a bad conscience and our bodies washed with pure water,
holding on to the confession of our hope, for he who has promised is faithful.
Let us think of ways to stir one another up to love and good works,
without giving up the idea of meeting together, as is the custom of some, but exhorting one another, and all the more so as you see the Day approaching.
For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there is no sacrifice left for sins,
but a formidable expectation of judgment, and an ardor of fire that will devour the adversaries.
The man who does not respect the law of Moses dies without mercy, on the word of two or three witnesses.
What worse punishment do you think will be counted worthy of him who trampled under foot the Son of God, who held the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified to be ungodly, and who insulted the Spirit of grace?
For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine. I will reciprocate, says the Lord. And again: "The Lord will judge his people."
It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
But remember the days of old, when, after being enlightened, you endured a great struggle in sufferings:
on the one hand, by being exposed to opprobrium and oppression, on the other hand, by becoming partakers of those who were thus treated.
But you have had mercy on me in my chains, and you have gladly accepted the plundering of your goods, knowing that you have a better and lasting good in heaven for you.
Do not therefore throw away your audacity, which has a great reward.
For you need endurance, so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
"In a very short time, he who comes will come and will not wait.
But the righteous will live by faith. If he retracts, my soul has no pleasure in him. »
But we are not of those who retreat to destruction, but of those who have faith for the salvation of the soul.
Now faith is the assurance of things that we hope for, the proof of those that we do not see.
For it is by this that the ancients obtained approval.
By faith, we understand that the universe was formed by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made from visible things.
By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, by which he received the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying with regard to his gifts, and by which, although dead, he still speaks.
It was by faith that Enoch was taken up, that he might not see death, and that he was not found, because God translated him. For it has been testified to him that before his translation he had been very pleasing to God.
Without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for he who draws near to God must believe that He exists and that He is the rewarder of those who seek Him.
By faith, Noah, warned of things not yet seen, and animated by pious fear, prepared a ship to save his house, by which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness according to faith.
It was by faith that Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to the place he was to receive as an inheritance. He went out, without knowing where he was going.
It was by faith that he lived as a stranger in the promised land, as in a land that did not belong to him, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.
For he was waiting for the city which has foundations, and of which God is the builder and the craftsman.
It was by faith that Sarah herself received the power to conceive, and that she bore a child at an advanced age, for she considered him faithful who had promised.
Therefore one man has begotten as many children as the stars of heaven are numerous, and as innumerable as the sand that is by the sea, and he is as if dead.
All these died in the faith, not having received the promises, but having seen and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on earth.
For those who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own.
If indeed they had thought of the country from which they left, they would have had time to return.
But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, of being called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
By faith, Abraham, put to the test, offered Isaac. For he who had received the promises with joy offered his only son,
to whom it was said, "Your seed shall be numbered as that of Isaac,"
concluding that God is able to rise even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also raised him from the dead.
It was by faith that Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even in regard to things to come.
It was by faith that Jacob, at his death, blessed each of Joseph's sons and prostrated himself, leaning on the top of his staff.
It was by faith that Joseph, when his end drew near, mentioned the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones.
It was by faith that Moses, at his birth, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they did not fear the king's order.
It was by faith that Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
preferring to share in the mistreatment of God's people rather than enjoy for a time the pleasures of sin,
considering the reproach of Christ as greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he expected the reward of it.
It was by faith that he left Egypt, without fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured, as if he saw Him who is invisible.
By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them.
It was by faith that they crossed the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.
It was by faith that the walls of Jericho fell after being surrounded for seven days.
It was by faith that Rahab the harlot did not perish with the disobedient, having received the spies in peace.
What more shall I say? For I would lack time if I spoke of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.
who, by faith, have subdued kingdoms, exercised justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,
extinguished the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, strengthened themselves from their weakness, became powerful in war, and put foreign armies to flight.
Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, in order to obtain a better resurrection.
Others have been tried by mockery and flogging, and even by chains and imprisonment.
They were stoned. They were sawn off. They were tempted. They were killed by the sword. They came and went, dressed in sheep's skins and goatskins, in misery, affliction, ill-treatment,
they whom the world was not worthy, wandering in the deserts, the mountains, the caves and the holes of the earth.
All these, after having been commended for their faith, have not received the promise,
God having planned something better for us, so that, without us, they would not be perfect.
Wherefore, we who are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, cast off every burden and the sin which so easily envelops us, and run with perseverance in the race that is set before us,
looking to Jesus, the father and finisher of the faith, who, for the joy that was reserved for him, endured the cross, despising his shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
For consider him who has endured such a contradiction of sinners against himself, so that you may not grow weary, failing in your souls.
You have not yet resisted to the point of blood, fighting against sin.
You have forgotten the exhortation which resonates with you as with children, "My son, do not take lightly the punishment of the Lord, and do not let yourselves be discouraged when he rebukes you;
for he whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and chastises every son he receives. »
It is for the discipline that you endure. God treats you like children; for what son is there that his father does not correct?
But if you are deprived of the discipline, in which all have had a part, you are illegitimate, and not children.
Besides, the fathers of our flesh have chastised us, and we have respected them. Shouldn't we rather be subject to the Father of spirits and live?
For they chastised us for a few days, as they saw fit, but he did it for our good, so that we might share in his holiness.
All chastisement seems for the moment not joyful, but painful; but then he brings forth the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those whom he has formed.
Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the knees that are weak,
and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather healed.
Seek peace with all men and sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord,
seeing that there is no man who fails in the grace of God, that no root of bitterness sprouts in you and defiles many people,
that there should be no fornicator or profane, like Esau, who sold his birthright for a meal.
For you know that when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he could not find a place where he could change his mind, although he sought it with tears.
For you have not come to a mountain that could be touched and that burned with fire, nor to darkness, nor to darkness, nor to storm,
nor at the sound of a trumpet, nor at the voice of words, that those who heard it begged that not one more word should be addressed to them,
for they could not endure what had been commanded: "If any animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned."
The apparition was so frightening that Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."
But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable multitude of angels,
to the gathering and assembly of the firstborn inscribed in heaven, to God, the judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, which is better than that of Abel.
Be careful not to refuse the one who speaks. For if they have not escaped the rejection of him who warned on earth, how much more shall we who turn away from him who warns from heaven,
whose voice shook the earth then, but which he has now promised, saying, "Once more, I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."
This expression "once more" means that what is shaken is taken away, as are things done, so that what is not shaken remains.
Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we serve God pleasantly, with reverence and fear,
for our God is a devouring fire.
May fraternal love continue.
Do not forget to give hospitality to strangers, for by acting in this way, some have received angels without knowing it.
Remember those who are in bonds, as bound to them, and those who are abused, since you are also in the body.
Let marriage be honored above all, and let the bed be free from defilement; but God will judge fornicators and adulterers.
Be free from the love of money, content with what you have, for he said, "I will not leave you, nor will I forsake you."
Thus, it is with courage that we say, "The Lord is my helper. I fear nothing. What can man do to me? »
Remember your leaders, the men who preached the word of God to you, and, considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
Do not let yourselves be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart should be strengthened by grace, and not by food, which has not been enjoyed by those who were thus occupied.
We have an altar on which those who serve the sanctity of the tabernacle are not allowed to eat.
For the bodies of these animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin, are burned outside the camp.
That is why Jesus also, in order to sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
Let us therefore go to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
For we do not have a lasting city here, but we are looking for the one that is to come.
Through him, therefore, let us offer unceasingly to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that proclaim fidelity to his name.
And do not forget to do good and to share, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account, in order to do it with joy and not with groans, for it would be of no use to you.
Pray for us, for we are convinced that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.
I beg you earnestly to do this, so that I may be restored to you sooner.
May the God of peace, who raised from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an everlasting covenant, our Lord Jesus,
accomplish you in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his eyes, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
But I exhort you, brethren, to endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in a few words.
Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.
Greet all your leaders and all the saints. The Italians greet you.
Grace be with you all. Amen.
James, servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes that are in the Scattering: Greetings.
Rejoice, my brethren, when you fall into various temptations,
knowing that the trial of your faith produces endurance.
Let endurance do its perfect work, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
But if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, who gives to all freely and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
But let him ask in faith, without doubt, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and agitated.
For this man must not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
He is a man of double thinking, unstable in all his ways.
Let the brother in humility glory in his high position;
and the rich, because he is made humble, for, like the flower in the grass, he will pass away.
For the sun rises with a burning wind and withers the grass; the flower it contains falls off, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. Thus, the rich man will also wither in his occupations.
Blessed is he who endures temptation, for after he has been accepted, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him.
Let no one say, when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one.
But everyone is tempted when he is attracted by his own lust and seduces.
Then covetousness, when it has conceived, engenders sin. And sin, when it has become an adult, produces death.
Make no mistake, my beloved brethren.
Every pleasant gift and every perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights, in whom there is no variation or shadow.
Of his own will, he has begotten us by the word of truth, so that we may be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every one be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to be angry;
for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
Therefore, rejecting all defilement and all overflow of wickedness, humbly receive the implanted word, which can save your souls.
But put the word into practice, and do not be content to listen, deceiving yourselves.
For if anyone listens to the word and does not do it, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;
for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what sort of man he was.
But he who looks at the perfect law of liberty and perseveres, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer, he will be blessed in what he does.
If any of you believe himself to be religious when he does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, the religion of that man is worthless.
This is what a pure and spotless religion is before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to guard against the defilements of the world.
My brethren, hold back with partiality the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.
For if a man dressed in fine clothes, with a golden ring, enters your synagogue, and a poor man dressed in filthy clothes enters also,
and let you pay special attention to the one who is dressed in fine clothes, and say, "Sit here in a good place," and say to the poor, "Stand there," or "Sit down on my footstool."
Have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and have you not become judges of evil thoughts?
Listen, my beloved brethren. Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom He has promised to those who love Him?
But you have dishonored the poor man. Don't the rich oppress you and take you personally to court?
Do they not blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
But if you fulfill the royal law according to Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing well.
But if you show partiality, you commit a sin, being found guilty by the law as transgressors.
For he who observes the whole law, and who stumbles at one point, becomes guilty of all.
For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not commit murder." Now, if you do not commit adultery, but commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
Thus speak and act like men who are to be judged by the law of liberty.
For judgment is merciless to him who has not shown mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
What is it, my brethren, for a man to say that he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?
And if a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food,
and let one of you say to them, "Go in peace. Warm yourselves and be satisfied"; but you have not given it what the body needs, what is the use of it?
In the same way, faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.
Yes, a man will say, "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
You believe that God is unique. You are doing well. The demons also believe, and they tremble.
But do you want to know, vain man, that faith without works is dead?
Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works, by offering his son Isaac on the altar?
You see that faith has acted with its works, and that it is by works that faith has been perfected.
Thus was fulfilled the Scripture which says, "Abraham believed in God, and it was imputed to him as righteousness," and he was called the friend of God.
You see, then, that it is by works that a man is justified, and not by faith alone.
Similarly, was not Rahab the harlot justified by the works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead.
Let not many of you become masters, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive a more severe judgment.
For we all stumble into many things. He who does not stumble in words is a perfect person, capable also of bridling the whole body.
For we put bits in the horses' mouths to make them obey us, and we guide their whole bodies.
Here are the ships also, although they are so large and driven by violent winds, are guided by a very small rudder, where the pilot desires.
Thus the tongue is also a small member, and it boasts of great things. See how a small fire can spread into a large forest!
And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, which sets fire to the course of nature, and which is set ablaze by hell.
For every kind of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures can be tamed and has been tamed by man;
but no one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of a deadly poison.
With it we bless our God and our Father, and with it we curse men made in the image of God.
From the same mouth come blessing and curse. My brothers, it must not be so.
Does a spring spring spring from the same opening fresh and bitter water?
Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine figs? Thus, no spring produces both salt water and fresh water.
Who is wise and intelligent among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done with the meekness of wisdom.
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast or lie against the truth.
This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but it is earthly, sensual and demonic.
For where there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there is confusion and every evil deed.
But the wisdom that comes from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
Where do wars and battles come from among you? Do they not come from your pleasures which are disputed in your limbs?
You covet, and you have not. You kill and covet, and you can't get. You fight and you make war. You don't have , because you don't ask .
You ask, and you do not receive, because you ask with evil motives, in order to spend it for your pleasures.
Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility to God? Whoever wants to be the friend of the world, therefore, makes himself an enemy of God.
Or do you think that Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit that lives in us groans jealously"?
But it gives more grace. Therefore it is said, "God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble."
Be subject to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Purify your hands, sinners. Purify your hearts, you who are double-minded.
Complain, mourn and weep. May your laughter turn into mourning and your joy into sadness.
Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a practitioner of the law, but a judge.
Only one is the legislator, who has the power to save and destroy. But who are you to judge others?
Come now, you who say: "Today or tomorrow, let us go to this city, let us spend a year there, do trade and make a profit."
Yet, you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. Because what is your life? For you are a vapour that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
For you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that."
But now you are glorifying in your pride. Now, any boasting of this kind is bad.
Thus, whoever knows that good must be done and does not do it, he commits a sin.
Come now, rich people, weep and cry over the misfortunes that befall you.
Your riches are corrupted and your clothes are eaten away by moths.
Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will serve as a testimony against you; they will devour your flesh like fire. You have amassed your treasure in the last days.
Behold, the wages of the laborers who have mowed your fields, whom thou hast withheld by fraud, cry out; and the cries of those who have reaped have entered the ears of the Lord of hosts.
You have lived in luxury on earth, and you have taken your pleasure. You have nourished your hearts as in a day of carnage.
You have condemned and murdered the righteous. He can't resist you.
Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, with patience with it, until he receives the rain of the morning and the afternoon.
You too, be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you will not be judged. Here the judge is standing at the door.
Take, brethren, as an example of suffering and perseverance, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
Behold, we call them blessed are those who have endured. You have heard of Job's perseverance and you have seen the Lord in the denouement, and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
But above all, my brethren, swear not - neither by heaven nor by earth, nor by any other oath; but let your "yes" be "yes," and your "no," "no," so that you do not fall into hypocrisy.
Is any of you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praises.
Is any of you sick? Let him call the elders of the assembly, and let them pray for him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
The prayer of faith will heal the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective.
Elijah was a man of a nature similar to ours. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it would not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
He prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit.
Brethren, if any of you deviate from the truth and someone brings him back,
let him know that he who brings a sinner back from error from his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.
Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who live as strangers in Dispersion, in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, that ye may obey Jesus Christ, and be sprinkled with his blood: grace and peace be multiplied unto you.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his great mercy, has caused us to be reborn to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
for an incorruptible, unalterable, and imperishable inheritance, which is reserved for you in heaven,
you who, by the power of God, are kept by faith for a salvation ready to be revealed at the last moment.
This is your great joy, although for a little while longer, if need be, you have been afflicted by various trials,
so that the trial of your faith, which is more precious than perishable gold, even if it is tried by fire, may give rise to praise, glory and honor, at the revelation of Jesus Christ,
that you love without knowing him. In him, though now you do not see him, but in believing, you rejoice in unspeakable joy full of glory,
receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
As for this salvation, the prophets have sought and sought carefully. They have prophesied the grace that will be granted to you,
seeking to know to whom or at what time the Spirit of Christ who was in them referred when he foretold the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow them.
It has been revealed to them that they are not serving themselves, but you, in those things which have been preached to you now by those who have preached the Good News to you through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, which the angels want to examine.
So prepare your minds for action. Be sober, and put all your hope in the grace that will be granted to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
as obedient children, not conforming to your former lusts as in your ignorance,
but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,
for it is written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy."
If you call upon him as Father, who, without respect for persons, judges according to the work of each one, spend here the time of your life as strangers in reverent fear,
knowing that you have been redeemed, not with corruptible things, such as silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down by your fathers,
but by a precious blood, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot, the blood of Christ,
which was already known before the foundation of the world, but which has been revealed in this last century for your sake,
you who, through him, believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and your hope may be in God.
Having purified your souls by obeying the truth by the Spirit, in sincere fraternal affection, love one another with all your heart fervently,
being born again, not of a corruptible seed, but of an incorruptible seed, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever.
For, "All flesh is like grass, and all the glory of man like the flower in the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls;
but the word of the Lord endures forever. This is the word of the Good News that has been preached to you.
Rejecting therefore all malice, all fraud, all hypocrisy, all envy, all backbiting,
yearn, like newborn children, to pure spiritual milk, that you may grow with it,
if you have tasted the goodness of the Lord.
Come to him, living stone, rejected by men, but chosen by God, precious.
You too, as living stones, are built up into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
For this is contained in the Scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious. Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed. »
To you who believe, then, it is honor, but to the disobedient, "The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone,"
and, "a stumbling block and a rock of offense." For they stumble upon the word, disobeying what they were destined for.
But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people won over to God, to proclaim the excellence of Him who has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
Formerly you were not a people, but now you are the people of God, you who did not obtain mercy, but who now have obtained mercy.
Beloved, I beg you, as strangers and pilgrims, to abstain from carnal lusts that wage war on the soul,
and to have good conduct among the nations, so that in those who are spoken of against you as evildoers, your good works may be seen, and God may be glorified in the day of punishment.
Wherefore, for the Lord's sake, submit yourselves to every ordinance of man, whether it be the king, as sovereign,
or governors, as sent by him to punish the wicked and praise those who do well.
For it is the will of God that you silence, by your good deeds, the ignorance of fools.
Live as free people, not using your freedom as a cover for wickedness, but as slaves of God.
Honor all men. Love fraternity. Fear God. Honor the king.
Servants, be subject to your masters in all respect, not only to those who are good and meek, but also to the wicked.
Indeed, it is praiseworthy that someone endures pains, unjust sufferings, out of conscience towards God.
For what glory is there in that, when you sin, you patiently endure the blows? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is praiseworthy before God.
For this you have been called to, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his footsteps,
he who did not sin, "and in his mouth there was no deceit."
When he was cursed, he did not curse in his turn. When he suffered, he did not threaten, but he left it to him who judges justly.
He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that, dead to sins, we might live for righteousness. It is by his wounds that you have been healed.
For you went astray like sheep; but now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
In the same way, wives, be subject to your husbands, so that, if any do not obey the Word, they may be won over by the conduct of their wives, without a word,
seeing your pure conduct in fear.
Let not your beauty come from an outward adornment, such as braiding your hair, wearing gold ornaments, or dressing yourself in fine clothes,
but of the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and tranquil spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God.
For this is how the holy women who hoped in God were formerly adorned by being subject to their husbands.
So Sarah obeys Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you are now, if you do well and do not allow yourself to be frightened by any terror.
You, husbands, likewise, live with your wives according to knowledge, honoring the wife as the weakest vessel, as being also co-heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
Finally, be all animated by the same sentiments, compassionate, loving like brothers, full of tenderness, courteous,
not returning evil for evil, nor insult for injury, but blessing on the contrary, knowing that you have been called to this, in order to inherit a blessing.
For, "Whoever wants to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from uttering lies.
Let him turn away from evil and do good. Let him seek peace and pursue it.
For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. »
Now, who will hurt you if you become imitators of what is good?
But even if you have to suffer for righteousness, you are blessed. "Do not fear what they fear, and do not be troubled."
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Be always ready to respond to all those who ask you for the reason of the hope that is in you, with humility and fear,
by having a good conscience. Thus, while you are spoken of as evildoers, those who curse your right way of living in Christ may be disappointed.
For it is better, if it be the will of God, that you suffer for having done good than for having done evil.
Because Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit,
in which he also went to preach to the spirits in prison,
who before were disobedient when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ship was being built. In it, few persons, that is to say, eight souls, were saved by the water.
This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you - not by ridding yourself of the filth of the flesh, but by responding to a good conscience toward God - through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
who is at the right hand of God, having ascended into heaven, the angels, authorities, and powers being subject to him.
Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same spirit; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased to sin,
so that you may no longer live the rest of your time in the flesh according to the lusts of men, but according to the will of God.
For we have spent enough time in satisfying the desires of the heathen, and in walking in fornication, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, carousels, and abominable idolatries.
They find it strange that you do not run with them in the same rioting excesses, and they speak ill of you.
They will give an account to him who is willing to judge the living and the dead.
For it is for this purpose that the Good News has been preached even to the dead, that they may be judged as men in the flesh, but that they may live as before God in the spirit.
But the end of all things is near. Therefore, be sane, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.
And above all, be serious in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.
Be welcoming to each other, without complaining.
As each has received a gift, devote yourselves to serving one another, as good stewards of the grace of God in its various forms.
If anyone speaks, let it be as if it were God's own words. If anyone serves, let it be with the strength that God provides, so that in all things God may be glorified by Jesus Christ, to whom belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial that has been imposed on you to test you, as if a strange thing were happening to you.
But because you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, that at the revelation of his glory you may also rejoice with exceedingly joy.
If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their side, he is blasphemed, but on your side, he is glorified.
Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a malefactor, or as meddling in the affairs of others.
But if any of you suffer because he is a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God about it.
For the time has come when judgment must begin with the house of God. If it begins with us first, what will happen to those who do not obey the Good News of God?
"If it is difficult for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?"
Let those who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to Him as to a faithful Creator.
Wherefore I exhort the elders among you, who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that shall be revealed:
lead the flock of God that is in your midst, exercising surveillance, not by compulsion, but voluntarily; not for dishonest gain, but voluntarily;
not as if to dominate those entrusted to you, but by serving as an example to the flock.
When the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade.
In the same way, you younger people, be subject to the oldest. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility and submit yourselves to one another, for "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,
by casting all your worries on him, for he cares for you.
Be sober and self-controlled. Be vigilant. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, looking for whom he can devour.
Resist him firmly in faith, knowing that your brethren who are in the world are also suffering.
But may the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory through Jesus Christ, after you have suffered a little, perfect you, strengthen you, strengthen you, and fix you.
To him is glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.
By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting you and testifying to you that it is the true grace of God in which you find yourself.
She who is in Babylon, chosen with you, greets you. Mark, my son, greets you also.
Greet each other with a kiss of love. Peace be with all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained with us such precious faith in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:
May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord,
seeing that his divine power has granted us all that pertains to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who has called us by his own glory and virtue,
by which he has granted us his precious and immense promises, that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through covetousness.
Yes, and for this very reason, adding on your part all diligence, in your faith provide moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge;
and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control, perseverance; and in perseverance, piety;
and in piety, fraternal affection; and in fraternal affection, love.
For if these things are yours and if they abound, they enable you not to be idle or fruitless in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the purification of his former sins.
Therefore, brethren, apply yourselves to making your calling and your election more secure. For if you do these things, you will never stumble.
For thus you will be richly provided to enter into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Therefore I will not neglect to remind you of these things, although you know them and are established in the present truth.
I find it good, while I am in this tent, to stimulate you by reminding you,
knowing that the stripping of my tent will not be long in coming, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made me understand.
Yes, I will make every effort so that you can always remember these things, even after I am gone.
For we did not follow cunning fables when we made known to you the power and advent of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses to his majesty.
For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when the voice came to him from the majestic glory: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
We heard this voice from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
We have a surer prophetic word; and you do well to pay attention to it as to a lamp that shines in a dark place, until the day rises and the morning star rises in your hearts,
knowing first of all that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.
For no prophecy ever came from the will of man, but holy men of God spoke, moved by the Holy Spirit.
But false prophets have arisen among the people, just as false teachers will arise among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, denying even the Master who bought them, and bringing upon themselves speedy destruction.
Many will follow their immoral ways, and, as a result, the way of truth will be slandered.
Out of covetousness, they will exploit you with deceitful words; their sentence, coming from the past, does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber.
For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but cast them into Tartarus and committed them to pits of darkness to be reserved for judgment;
and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly,
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, after having made them an example to those who would live in an ungodly manner,
and delivered the righteous Lot, who was greatly afflicted by the lascivious life of the wicked
(for this righteous man who dwelt in the midst of them was tormented in his righteous soul, day by day, to see and hear unlawful acts),
then the Lord knows how to deliver the righteous from temptation and keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,
but especially those who walk according to the flesh in lust for defilement and despise authority. Bold, selfish, they are not afraid to speak ill of dignitaries,
whereas the angels, though more powerful, do not pass a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord.
But these, as irrational beings, born natural animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking ill of what they do not know, will be destroyed by their destruction,
receiving the wages of iniquity; people who delight in reveling in the day, the blemishes and defects, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;
having eyes full of adultery, and who cannot cease to sin, seducing troubled souls, having a heart drawn to covetousness, accursed children!
Leaving the right path, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam, son of Beor, who loved the wages of iniquity;
but he was rebuked for his own disobedience. A voiceless donkey spoke with a man's voice and stopped the prophet's madness.
They are wells without water, clouds driven by the storm, to whom the darkness of darkness has been reserved forever.
For by empty and puffed up speeches they attract by the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who escape from those who live in error;
they promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to corruption; for man is enslaved by him who dominates him.
For if, after having escaped from the defilement of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they allow themselves to be drawn and overcome in it again, this last condition has become worse to them than the first.
For it is better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than after having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment which has been delivered to them.
But what happened to them is what the true proverb says: "The dog returns to its vomiting," and "the sow that has washed wallows in the mire."
Here now, beloved, is the second letter I wrote to you; and in both of them I stimulate your sincerity by reminding you of the
that you must remember the words that were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the command that we, the apostles of the Lord and Saviour, have given,
knowing first that in the last days scoffers will come, walking according to their own lusts
and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? For from the day when the fathers fell asleep, everything continues as at the beginning of creation. »
For they willfully forget that there were heavens from the beginning, and an earth formed of water and in the midst of water by the word of God,
which means that the world that existed at the time, overflowed by water, perished.
But the heavens that now exist and the earth, by the same word, have been stored up for fire, being reserved for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
But do not forget, beloved, that a day is to the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as a day.
The Lord is not slow with regard to his promise, as some are with regard to slowness; but he is patient with us, not wanting anyone to perish, but that all should come to repentance.
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night, when the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, when the elements will dissolve in fiery heat, and when the earth and the works that are in it will be burned.
Therefore, since all these things will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people are you to be in a holy life and in godliness,
longing for the advent of the day of God, which will make the blazing heavens disappear and melt the elements with fiery heat?
But, according to his promise, we look forward to new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these things, apply yourselves to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless before Him.
Consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, as our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you,
as also in all his letters, speaking of these things. In these letters, there are things that are difficult to understand, which the ignorant and the disoriented distort, as they also do for the other Scriptures, for their own destruction.
Therefore you, beloved, knowing these things beforehand, take heed that, carried away by the error of the wicked, you do not fall from your firmness.
But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, now and forever. Amen.
What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have contemplated and our hands have touched, concerning the word of life
(and life was revealed, and we saw, and we testify, and we declare to you life, eternal life, which was with the Father and was revealed to us);
What we have seen and heard we proclaim to you, so that you also may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
And we write these things to you, that our joy may be complete.
This is the message which we have heard from him and which we proclaim to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him.
If we say that we are in fellowship with Him and that we walk in darkness, we are lying and we are not telling the truth.
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we are in fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we say that we have not sinned, we are making him lie, and his word is not in us.
My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have a counselor with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous.
And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, not only for our sins, but also for those of the whole world.
This is how we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
He who says, "I know him," and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
But the love of God is certainly perfect in him who keeps his word. This is how we know that we are in him:
Whoever says that he abides in him must also walk as he walked.
Brethren, I am not writing to you a new commandment, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The ancient commandment is the word you heard from the beginning.
Again I write to you a new commandment, which is true in him and in you, for the darkness is departing and the true light is already shining.
He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness until now.
He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion for him to fall.
But he who hates his brother is in darkness, he walks in darkness and does not know where he is going, because darkness has blinded his eyes.
I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have conquered the evil one. I am writing to you, little children, because you know the Father.
I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, let the word of God abide in you, and because you have overcome the evil one.
Do not love the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father's love is not in him.
For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life—is not of the Father, but of the world.
The world passes away with its lusts, but he who does the will of God abides forever.
Little children, we are at the end times, and as you have learned that the Antichrist is coming, even now several Antichrists have arisen. We know from this that this is the last hour.
They came out of our house, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they have gone, so that it may be revealed that none of them belong to us.
You have the anointing of the Holy One, and you all have the knowledge.
I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is truth.
Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is the Antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.
He who denies the Son has not the Father. He who confesses the Son also has the Father.
Wherefore, as for you, let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will also abide in the Son and in the Father.
This is the promise he made to us, eternal life.
I have written these things to you about those who want to lead you astray.
As for you, the anointing which you have received from him remains in you, and you need no one to instruct you. But as his anointing teaches you all things, and it is true, and is not a lie, and as it has taught you, you will abide in him.
Now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears, we may be confident and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
If you know that he is righteous, you know that whoever practices righteousness is born of him.
See what great love the Father has given us, that we may be called children of God! That is why the world does not know us, because it has not known it.
Beloved, now we are children of God. What we will be has not yet been revealed; but we know that when he is revealed, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.
Whoever puts this hope in himself purifies himself, as he himself is pure.
Whoever sins also commits anarchy. Sin is anarchy.
You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and that there is no sin in him.
He who abides in him does not sin. He who sins has not seen him and does not know him.
Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who practices justice is just, as he himself is just.
He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
He who is born of God does not commit sin, for his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, since he is born of God.
It is in this that the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed. He who does not practice justice is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.
For this is the message you have heard from the beginning, that we must love one another -
unlike Cain, who was of the evil one and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds were evil, and those of his brother were righteous.
Do not be surprised, my brethren, if the world hates you.
We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers and sisters. He who does not love his brother remains in death.
He who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life that dwells in him.
To this we know love, for he gave his life for us. And we must lay down our lives for our brethren.
But whoever possesses the goods of the world and sees his brother in need, and then closes his heart with compassion against him, how does the love of God abide in him?
My little children, let us not love in words only, nor with tongue alone, but in deeds and in truth.
And by this we know that we are of the truth and that we persuade our hearts before him,
for if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows all things.
Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God;
and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight.
This is his commandment: that we believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, as he commanded.
He who keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. We know by this that he dwells in us, through the Spirit he has given us.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, to know if they are of God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.
By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh is of God,
and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh is not of God; this is the spirit of Antichrist, whose coming you have heard. However, he is already in the world.
You are of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
They are of the world. That is why they talk about the world, and the world listens to them.
We are of God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God does not listen to us. This is how we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
Beloved, let us love one another, for love comes from God; and whoever loves is born of God and knows God.
He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.
It is through this that the love of God has been revealed in us, that God has sent his only Son into the world, that we may live through him.
In this consists love, not that we have loved God, but that he has loved us and sent his Son as a sin offering for our sins.
Beloved, if God has loved us in this way, we must also love one another.
No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfect in us.
We know by this that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
We have seen and we testify that the Father sent the Son as the Savior of the world.
Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
We know and we have believed in the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
In this, love has been perfected among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, for what it is, we are also in this world.
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, for fear has a punishment. He who fears is not perfect in love.
We love him, because he loved us first.
If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
We have this commandment from him: that he who loves God should also love his brother.
Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. He who loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him.
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.
For it is loving God to keep his commandments. His commandments are not painful.
For everything that is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your faith.
Who is he who will overcome the world, if not the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
It is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by water alone, but by water and blood. It is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
For there are three people who bear witness:
the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and all three agree to be one.
If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for it is the testimony of God that he has given to his Son.
He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe in God has become a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given concerning his Son.
This testimony is this: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
He who has the Son has life. He who does not have the Son of God has no life.
I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
This is the assurance we have to him, that if we ask for anything according to his will, he listens to us.
And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have addressed to him.
If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he will ask, and God will give him life for those who commit a sin that does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that he must make a request on this subject.
All iniquity is a sin, and there is a sin that does not lead to death.
We know that he who is born of God does not sin, but he who is born of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him.
We know that we are of God, and that the whole world is under the sway of the evil one.
We know that the Son of God came and gave us understanding, that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
Little children, beware of idols.
The eldest, to the chosen one and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who know the truth,
because of the truth, which dwells in us, and will be with us forever:
May grace, mercy and peace be with us, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I rejoice very much to have found some of your children walking in the truth, as the Father has commanded us.
Now, I beg you, dear madam, not as if I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we had from the beginning, to love one another.
This is love, to walk according to his commandments. This is the command which you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is the deceiver, and the Antichrist.
Watch over yourselves, that we may not lose what we have accomplished, but that we may receive a full reward.
He who transgresses and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God. He who abides in teaching has the Father and the Son.
If someone comes to your house and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not welcome him,
for he who receives him participates in his evil deeds.
Having many things to write to you, I do not want to do it with paper and ink, but I hope to come to your house and talk to you face to face, so that our joy will be complete.
The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
The eldest to Gaius, the beloved, whom I love in truth.
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be healthy, as your soul prospers.
For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified to your truth, as you walk in the truth.
I have no greater joy than this: to hear of my children who walk in the truth.
Beloved, you do faithful work in all that you do for those who are brothers and strangers.
They testified to your love before the assembly. You will do well to send them on a journey in a manner worthy of God,
for it was for the sake of the Name that they went out, without taking anything from the Gentiles.
We must therefore welcome them, in order to be fellow workers for the truth.
I have written to the assembly, but Diotrephes, who loves to be the first among them, does not accept what we say.
Therefore, if I come, I will call attention to the deeds he commits, accusing us unjustly with wicked words. Not content with this, he himself does not receive the brethren, and those who wish to do so, he forbids and drives them out of the assembly.
Beloved, do not imitate what is bad, but what is good. He who does good is of God. He who does evil has not seen God.
Demetrius has the testimony of all, and of the truth itself; Yes, we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true.
I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with ink and a pen;
but I hope to see you soon. We will then talk to each other face to face. Peace be with you. Friends greet you. Greet friends by name.
Jude, servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are called, sanctified by God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:
May mercy, peace and charity be multiplied to you!
Beloved, while I was very anxious to write to you about our common salvation, I was compelled to write to you to exhort you to strive earnestly for the faith which has once and for all been delivered up to the saints.
For there are men who have crept secretly into the Church, the same men who have long been announced for this condemnation, impious men, who transform the grace of our God into indecency, and who deny our only Master, God and Lord, Jesus Christ.
I now want to remind you, although you already know it, that the Lord, after saving a people from the land of Egypt, then destroyed those who did not believe.
The angels who did not keep their first domain, but who deserted their own home, he kept in eternal bonds, under darkness, for the judgment of the great day.
As Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring cities, which, like them, gave themselves up to fornication and sought foreign flesh, are held up as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
But in the same way, these also, in their dreams, defile the flesh, despise authority, and slander the heavenly beings.
But Michael, the archangel, when he was struggling with the devil and discussing the body of Moses, did not dare to bring an insulting condemnation against him, but said, "May the Lord rebuke you!"
But these people speak ill of things they do not know. They are destroyed in those things which they naturally understand, as creatures without reason.
Woe to them! For they followed the way of Cain, they went astray in the error of Balaam, and they perished in the rebellion of Korah.
They are hidden rocks in your feasts of love, when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried by the winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted by the roots;
wild waves of the sea, foaming their own shame; of the wandering stars, for whom the darkness of darkness has been reserved forever.
It was about them that Enoch, the seventh since Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord has come with ten thousand of his saints,
to judge all, and to condemn all the ungodly for all the works of impiety which they have committed in an ungodly manner, and for all the harsh words which ungodly sinners have uttered against him. 16 These are murmuring and complaints, and they are people complaining.
They are murmurers and complainers, who walk according to their lusts, and their mouths speak proud words, showing respect for people, in order to obtain advantages.
But you, beloved, remember the words that were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
They have told you, "In the last time there will be scoffers, walking according to their own ungodly desires."
They are the divisive ones, who are sensual and who do not have the Spirit.
But you, beloved, be edified on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.
Remain in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life.
Some have compassion, making a distinction,
and others save, by snatching them from the fire with fear, by hating even clothes that are defiled by the flesh.
Now, to him who can preserve them from the fall and present you without blemish before the presence of his glory in great joy,
to God our Saviour, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, now and forever. Amen.
This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants the things that are soon to happen, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant John,
who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, concerning all that he saw.
Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things written therein, for the time is at hand.
John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace and peace to you from God, who is, who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,
and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the chief of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, who has washed us from our sins with his blood -
and who has made us a Kingdom, priests to his God and Father - to him the glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
Behold, he is coming in the clouds, and every eye shall see him, even those who have pierced him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn over him. So be it, Amen.
"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.
I, John, your brother and partner in oppression, Kingdom, and perseverance in Christ Jesus, was on the island called Patmos, because of the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
I was in the Spirit on the day of the Lord, and I heard a loud voice behind me, like a trumpet
who said, "What you see, write it down in a book and send it to the seven assemblies: at Ephesus, at Smyrna, at Pergamum, at Thyatira, at Sardis, at Philadelphia, and at Laodicea."
I turned around to see the voice speaking to me. And I turned around, and I saw seven golden candlesticks.
And among the candlesticks there was one that looked like a son of man, dressed in a robe that came down to his feet, and a golden girdle around his breast.
His head and hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.
His feet were like polished brass, as if he had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the sound of great waters.
He had seven stars in his right hand. From his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining to its highest degree.
When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me, saying, "Don't be afraid. I am the first and the last,
and the Living . I was dead, and behold, I am alive for ever and ever. Amen. I have the keys to death and hell.
Write down therefore the things that you have seen, the things that are, and the things that will happen in the future.
This is the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and of the seven golden candlesticks: The seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies. The seven candlesticks are the seven assemblies.
"Write to the angel of the assembly at Ephesus, 'He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks among the seven golden candlesticks, says these things:
"I know your works, your work, and your perseverance, and I know that you do not endure the wicked, that you have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and that you have found them false.
You have perseverance, you have endured for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary.
But I have this against you: it is that you have abandoned your first love.
Remember, therefore, whence thou didst fall, and repent, and do the first works; if not, I come to you quickly, and I will move your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
But what you have is that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, I will give food of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.
"Write to the angel of the assembly of Smyrna: 'The first and the last, who was dead and has come back to life, says these things:
"I know your works, the oppression, your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who call themselves Jews, and who are not, but who are a synagogue of Satan.
Don't be afraid of the things you are going to suffer. Behold, the devil is going to throw some of you into prison, to put you to the test, and you will be oppressed for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.
Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes will not be affected by the second death.
"Write to the angel of the congregation of Pergamum, 'He who has a sharp two-edged sword says these things:
"I know your works and the place where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is. You hold fast to my name, and you did not deny my faith in the days of Antipas, my witness, my believer, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.
But I have something to reproach you with, and that is that you have here people who follow the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat meat sacrificed to idols, and to indulge in fornication.
Similarly, you also have people who cling to the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.
Repent then, or I will come to you quickly and make war on them with the sword of my mouth.
Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, I will give hidden manna, I will give him a white stone, and on this stone will be written a new name that no one knows, except the one who receives it.
"Write to the angel of the assembly of Thyatira, 'The Son of God, whose eyes are like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like polished brass, says these things:
"I know your works, your love, your faith, your service, your perseverance, and I know that your last works are more numerous than the first.
But I have this against you: you tolerate your wife Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and deceives my servants to indulge in fornication and to eat meat sacrificed to idols.
I have given her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.
Behold, I will cast her and those who commit adultery with her into a bed of great oppression, if they do not repent of her works.
I will put his children to death, and all the congregations will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts. I will render to each one of you according to his works.
But to you, I say, to those who remain in Thyatira - all those who do not have this teaching, who do not know what some call "the deep things of Satan" - to you, I say, I do not impose any further burden on you.
Nevertheless, hold fast to what you have, until I come.
He who overcomes, he who keeps my works to the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.
Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
"And write to the angel of the assembly of Sardis, 'He who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says these things: 'I know your works, that you are reputed to be alive, but that you are dead.
Awaken and strengthen what remains, what you were going to throw away, for I have not found any of your works perfect before my God.
Remember, then, how you received and heard. Keep it and repent. So if you do not watch, I will come as a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you.
You have, however, in Sardis some names which have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy of it.
He who overcomes will be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the book of life, nor will I confess his name before my Father and his angels.
Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
"Write to the angel of the Philadelphia assembly, 'He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens and no one can close, and who shuts and no one opens, says these things:
"I know your works (behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one can shut), that you have a little strength, and that you have kept my word, and that you have not denied my name.
Behold, I bring some of the synagogue of Satan, of those who call themselves Jews, and are not, but who lie, and I bring them to bow down at your feet, and know that I have loved you.
Because you have kept my command to persevere, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is to come upon the whole world, to try the inhabitants of the earth.
I'm coming quickly! Hold fast to what you have, so that no one takes your crown.
Whoever overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will not come out of it again. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven from my God, and my new name.
Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
"Write to the angel of the assembly of Laodicea, 'The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, says these things:
"I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. I would like you to be cold or hot.
Therefore, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew you out of my mouth.
Because you say, "I am rich, I have acquired riches, and I have need of nothing," and you do not know that you are unfortunate, wretched, poor, blind, and naked.
I advise you to buy from me gold purified by fire, that you may be rich, and white garments, that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not appear, and eye-salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.
All those I love, I rebuke and chastise them. Be zealous, therefore, and repent.
Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will enter his house, I will sup with him, and he with me.
Whoever overcomes, I will give him to sit with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat with my Father on his throne.
Let him who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. »
After this, I looked and saw an open door in heaven; and the first voice I heard, like a trumpet speaking to me, was a voice saying, "Come up here, and I will show you what is to happen after this."
Immediately I was filled with the Spirit. And behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one seated on the throne
which resembled a jasper stone and a sardony. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.
Around the throne there were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones sat twenty-four elders, dressed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads.
From the throne come lightning, sounds and thunders. Before his throne burned seven lamps of fire, which are the seven Spirits of God.
In front of the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle of the throne, and around the throne, there were four living beings filled with eyes in front and behind.
The first living being was similar to a lion, the second living being was similar to a calf, the third living being had the face of a man, and the fourth living being was similar to a flying eagle.
The four living beings, which each have six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They do not cease, day and night, to repeat: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was, who is, and who is to come!"
When living beings give glory, honor and praise to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,
The twenty-four elders prostrate themselves before him who sits on the throne and adore him who lives forever and ever, and they throw their crowns before the throne, saying:
"Thou art worthy, O Lord and God, the Holy One, to receive glory, honor, and power, for it is Thou who created all things, and by Thy will they exist and were created."
I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a book written inside and out, closed by seven seals.
I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and break the seals thereof?"
No one, neither in the heavens above, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, has been able to open the book or look at it.
Then I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book or look at it.
One of the elders said to me: "Don't cry. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered: he who opens the book and its seven seals. »
I saw in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a lamb standing, as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth from all the earth.
Then he came, and took the book from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
When he had taken the book, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the lamb, each having a harp and golden cups filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
They sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the book and open its seals, for you were slain, and bought us for God with your blood from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation,
and made us kings and priests to our God; and we will reign over the earth. »
I looked, and heard as it were the voice of many angels around the throne, living beings and old men. Their number was ten thousand, ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,
saying with a loud voice, "The lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessings!"
I have heard all that was created in the heavens, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and all that is therein, say, "To him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, blessing, honor, glory, and dominion, forever and ever! Amen! »
The four living beings said, "Amen!" Then the elders prostrated themselves and prostrated themselves.
I saw that the lamb was opening one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings say, as in a voice of thunder, "Come and see!"
Then a white horse appeared, and the one who rode it held a bow. A crown was given him, and he went out as a conqueror, and to conquer.
When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!"
Another came out, a red horse. To him who rode it was given the power to take away the peace of the earth, and to cause men to kill one another. A great sword was given to him.
When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living being say, "Come and see!" And behold, there was a black horse, and the one who rode it held a set of scales in his hand.
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, "One choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don't spoil the oil and wine! »
When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature say, "Come and see!"
And behold, there was a pale horse, and the name of the one who rode it was death. Hades followed him. He was given authority over a quarter of the earth, to kill by the sword, by famine, by death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and the testimony of the Lamb that they had.
They cried out with a loud voice, saying, "How long, Master, the holy and the true, will you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?"
Each of them was given a long white robe. They were told that they were to rest for some time longer, until their companions in service and their brothers, who would also be killed like themselves, had finished their course.
I saw, when he opened the sixth seal, that there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as a sackcloth of horsehair, and the whole moon became as blood.
The stars of heaven fell to the earth, like a fig tree that drops its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.
The sky was lifted up like a scroll that is rolled up. Every mountain and every island was moved from their place.
The kings of the earth, the princes, the military chiefs, the rich, the strong, all the slaves and free men, hid themselves in the caves and rocks of the mountains.
And they said to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb,
for the great day of his wrath has come, and who can stand? » .
After this, I saw four angels standing in the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind blew on the land, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
I saw another angel ascend from the rising sun, having the seal of the living God. He cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to harm the land and the sea,
saying, "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the slaves of our God on their foreheads."
I heard the number of those who had been sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, from all the tribes of the children of Israel:
of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand,
of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand, of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand,
of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand,
of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand, of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand, and of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.
After this, I looked, and behold, a great crowd, which no one could number, from every nation, tribe, people, and language, stood before the throne and before the lamb, clothed in white robes, palms in hand.
They cried with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation is to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
All the angels stood around the throne, the elders and the four living beings; they fell on their faces before his throne and worshipped God,
saying, "Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and strength, be to our God forever and ever! Amen. »
One of the elders spoke up and said to me, "Who are those who are clothed in white robes, and where do they come from?"
I said to him: "Monseigneur, you know it." He told me, "These are the ones who came out of the great suffering. They washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Therefore they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne spreads his tent over them.
They will never hunger or thirst again. The sun will not strike them, nor any heat;
for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne feeds them and leads them to springs of life-giving waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. »
When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in the sky for about half an hour.
I saw the seven angels standing before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
Another angel came and stood above the altar, having a golden censer. They gave him many incense, that he might add them to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.
The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.
The angel took the censer, filled it with the fire of the altar, and then threw it on the earth. Thunders, sounds, lightning and an earthquake followed.
The seven angels who held the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
The first shot sounded, and hail and fire ensued, mingled with blood, which were thrown on the earth. A third of the earth was burned, a third of the trees were burned, and all green grass was burned.
The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great burning mountain was cast into the sea. A third of the sea became blood,
and a third of the living beings that were in the sea died. A third of the ships were destroyed.
The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, which fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
The name of the star is "Absinthe". A third of the waters became absinthe. Many people died because of these waters, because they had become bitter.
The fourth angel blew his trumpet. A third of the sun was struck, as well as a third of the moon and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened; the day would not shine for a third, and the night likewise.
I saw and heard an eagle flying in the middle of the sky and saying in a loud voice, "Woe! Misfortune! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the other blasts of the trumpets of the three angels, which are yet to sound! » .
The fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw from heaven a star that had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.
He opened the well of the abyss, and smoke rose from the well, like the smoke of a fiery furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke coming out of the shaft.
Then smoke came out of the locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as power to the scorpions of the earth.
They were told that they were not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any greenery, nor any tree, but only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
They were given power, not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was similar to the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a person.
In those days, people will seek death, and they will not find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.
The locusts were shaped like horses prepared for war. On their heads there were something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
They had hair like the hair of a woman, and their teeth were like those of lions.
They had cuirasses as iron cuirasses. The sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots and horses rushing to war.
They had scorpion-like tails, with stingers. In their tails, they have the power to harm men for five months.
They have the angel of the abyss as their king. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon", but in Greek, he is called "Apollyon".
The first misfortune is over. Behold, there are two more misfortunes that come after this one.
The sixth angel blew his trumpet. And I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar that is before God,
and saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Set free the four angels who are bound to the great river Euphrates!"
The four angels were set free who had been prepared for that hour, day, month, and year, to kill a third of mankind.
The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred millions. I heard the number of them.
Thus I saw in the vision the horses and those who rode them, having cuirasses of a fiery red, a blue of hyacinth, and a yellow of sulphur; and the horses' heads looked like lions' heads. From their mouths come fire, smoke and sulphur.
By these three plagues, a third of the human race was killed: by fire, smoke, and sulphur, which issued from their mouths.
For the power of horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and they have heads; and it is with them that they do harm.
The rest of mankind, who have not been killed by these plagues, have not repented of the works of his hands so as not to worship the demons and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.
They have not repented of their murders, their enchantments, their sexual immorality, nor their thefts.
I saw a mighty angel descend from heaven, clothed in a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
He held in his hand a small open book. He put his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the ground.
He cried out in a loud voice, as a lion roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders made their voices heard.
When the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not."
The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven
and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and what it contains, the earth and what it contains, and the sea and what it contains, that there shall be no more delay,
but that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he blows the trumpet, then the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he announced to his servants the prophets.
The voice which I heard from heaven, speaking to me again, said, "Go, take the open book in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land."
I went to see the angel, asking him to give me the little book. He told me, "Take it and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey. »
I took the little book from the angel's hand, and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.
I am told, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."
I was given a reed like a rod. Someone said, "Stand up and measure the temple of God, the altar and those who bow down therein.
Leave aside the outer court of the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will trample under foot the holy city for forty-two months.
I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed with sackcloth. »
These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, which stand before the Lord of the earth.
If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and devours their enemies. If anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.
They have the power to close the heavens, so that it does not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power to turn the waters into blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
When they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the abyss will make war on them, conquer them, and kill them.
Their corpses will be in the streets of the great city, spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.
People among peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations will look at their corpses for three and a half days, and will not allow their corpses to be put in a tomb.
The inhabitants of the earth will rejoice over them, and they will rejoice. They will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented the inhabitants of the earth.
After the three and a half days, a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear took possession of those who saw them.
I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." They ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them.
On that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
The second misfortune is over. Here comes the third misfortune quickly.
The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and great voices in heaven followed, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever! »
The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before the throne of God, fell on their faces and bowed down to God,
saying, "We thank you, O Lord God, the Almighty, he who is and was, for you have taken your great power and have reigned.
The nations have become angry, and your wrath has come, and the time has come to judge the dead, to give to your servants, the prophets, their reward, and to the saints and to those who fear your name, to the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth. »
The temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord appeared in his temple. Flashes of lightning, noises, thunder, an earthquake and a great hail followed.
A great sign appeared in the sky: a woman enveloped in the sun, the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
She was pregnant. She cried out in pain as she worked to give birth.
Another sign appeared in the sky. Behold, it was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads seven crowns.
Its tail attracted a third of the stars of the sky, and threw them on the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that, when she gave birth, he would devour her child.
She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron. His child was taken up to God and to his throne.
The woman has fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, to be fed there for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
There was a war in heaven. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.
They were not victorious. They no longer found a place in the sky.
The great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, the one called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, "Now the salvation, the power, the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ have come; for the accuser of our brethren was cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.
They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony. They did not love their lives, even to death.
Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to the land and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, animated by great anger, knowing that he has only a very short time. »
The dragon, seeing that he was cast down to the earth, persecuted the woman who had given birth to the male child.
The two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman to fly into the wilderness to her place of residence, so that she might be fed for a time, times, and half a time, away from the face of the serpent.
The serpent caused water to gush out of his mouth after the woman, like a river, so that she might be carried away by the current.
The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had caused to gush out of its mouth.
The dragon became angry with the woman and went to make war on the rest of her descendants, who keep the commandments of God and hold the testimony of Jesus.
Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast come up from the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads, names of blasphemy.
The beast I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.
One of his heads appeared to have been mortally wounded. His mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast.
They worshipped the dragon, because he had given his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is capable of waging war against him? »
He was given a mouth that uttered great things and blasphemies. The power to make war for forty-two months was given to him.
He opened his mouth to blaspheme against God, to blaspheme his name, his dwelling, and those who dwell in heaven.
It was given to him to make war on the saints and to conquer them. Authority over every tribe, every people, every language, and every nation has been given to him.
All the inhabitants of the earth will worship him, all those whose names were not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb that was slain.
If anyone has ears, let him hear.
If someone has to go into captivity, he will go into captivity. If anyone is to be killed by the sword, he must be killed. This is the endurance and faith of the saints.
I saw another beast rise from the earth. She had two horns like a lamb and she spoke like a dragon.
She exercises in his presence all the authority of the first beast. It compels the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound has been healed.
She performs great wonders, even sending fire down from heaven to the earth, in the eyes of the people.
It deceives my people who dwell on the earth, because of the signs which it has been given to them to perform before the beast, by telling the inhabitants of the earth to make an image to the beast that has had the wound of the sword and has lived.
It was given to him to make the image of the beast breathe, so that the image of the beast might speak and put to death all those who would not worship the image of the beast.
It causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to receive marks on the right hand or on the forehead;
and that no one can buy or sell without having this mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.
I looked, and behold, the Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with him a number of a hundred and forty-four thousand, who had his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters and the sound of great thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.
They sing a new hymn before the throne, before the four living beings and before the elders. No one could learn this song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed from the earth.
These are those who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. They are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed from among men by Jesus, the firstfruits of God and the Lamb.
There has been no lie in their mouths, for they are blameless.
I saw an angel flying in the midst of heaven, having everlasting Good News to proclaim to the inhabitants of the earth, to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people.
He said in a loud voice, "Fear the Lord, and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship Him who made heaven, earth, sea, and springs of water! »
Another, a second angel, followed, saying, "Babylon the great has fallen, who has made all nations drink the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
Another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
he too will drink the wine of the wrath of God, prepared without mixture in the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented in fire and brimstone, in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb.
The smoke of their torment rises forever and ever. They have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.
This is the perseverance of the saints, of those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. »
I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write, Blessed henceforth are the dead who die in the Lord!" "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their works follow them."
I looked, and I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud a man sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
Another angel came out of the temple and cried out with a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, "Send your sickle and reap, for the hour of reaping has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
He who sat on the cloud threw his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
Another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven. He also had a sharp sickle.
Another angel came out of the altar, he who has power over the fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Send forth your sharp sickle and harvest the grapes of the vine of the earth, for the grapes of the earth are ripe."
The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, collected the harvest from the earth, and threw it into the great vat of the wrath of God.
The vat was trampled out of the city, and blood flowed out of the vat to the bridles of the horses to the height of one thousand six hundred stadia.
I saw in heaven another great and wonderful sign: seven angels who held the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God ends.
I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had conquered the beast, his image and the number of his names, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and wonderful are your works, O Lord God, the Almighty! Righteous and true are your ways, King of the nations.
Who would not fear you, Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. For all the nations will come and bow down to you. For your righteous deeds have been revealed. »
After this, I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was opened in heaven.
And the seven angels who held the seven plagues came out, clothed in pure and bright linen, and wearing golden belts around their breasts.
One of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven golden cups full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
The temple was filled with smoke because of the glory of God and His power. No one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, "Go, pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God."
The first went to scatter its cup on the earth, and it became a painful ulcer for the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshipped its image.
The second angel poured his cup into the sea, which became blood like that of a dead man. All the living beings of the sea died.
The third poured his cup into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
I heard the angel of the waters say, "You are righteous, you who are and who were, O Holy One, for you have judged these things.
For they shed the blood of the saints and prophets, and you gave them blood to drink. They deserve this. »
I heard the altar say, "Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, your judgments are true and just."
The fourth poured out his cup on the sun, and it was given to him to burn men with fire.
The people were burned by great heat, and the people blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.
The fifth poured out his cup on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They were biting their tongues because of the pain,
and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers. They still haven't repented of their deeds.
The sixth poured his cup on the great river, the Euphrates. Its waters dried up, so that the way might be prepared for the kings who will come from the rising sun.
I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, like frogs;
for they are the spirits of demons, who work wonders, and who go to the kings of all the inhabited earth, in order to gather them together for the battle of the great day of God the Almighty.
"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his clothes, that he may not walk naked, and that his shame may not be seen. »
He gathered them together in the place which is called in Hebrew "Harmagedon."
The seventh poured his cup into the air. And a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
There was lightning, sounds, thunders, and a great earthquake, such as has never been since there have been men on earth, an earthquake so great and so powerful.
The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great in the sight of God was remembered, to give her the cup of wine of the ardor of her wrath.
All the islands fled, and the mountains were not found.
Large hailstones, the weight of a talent, fell from the sky on the people. God was blasphemed because of the plague of hail, for this plague was extremely violent.
One of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came to me and said, "Come hither. I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on the great waters,
and with which the kings of the earth have given themselves up to fornication. The inhabitants of the earth have become drunk with the wine of his fornication. »
He carried me by the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
This woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She held in her hand a golden cup filled with abominations and impurities of the earth's fornication.
And on her forehead was written a name: "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
I saw this woman drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I was seized with great astonishment.
The angel said to me, "Why are you surprised? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and the beast that bears her, the one with the seven heads and the ten horns.
The beast you saw was, and it is no more; it will come out of the abyss and go to perdition. The inhabitants of the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life since the foundation of the world, will be amazed when they see that the beast was, and is not, and that it will be present.
Here is the spirit that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.
They are seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. When he comes, he will have to persist a little.
The beast that was, and is no more, is itself also an eighth, and is of the number of the seven; and it is going to destruction.
The ten horns you have seen are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who receive authority as kings with the beast for an hour.
They have one thought, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
They will make war on the lamb, and the lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with him are called, chosen, and faithful. »
He said to me, "The waters that you have seen, where the harlot is sitting, are peoples, crowds, nations, and tongues.
The ten horns that you have seen, they and the beast, will hate the harlot, will devour her, strip her, eat her flesh, and consume her with fire.
For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, to agree, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
The woman you have seen is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth. »
After this, I saw another angel descend from heaven, who had great authority. The earth was illuminated by his glory.
He cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Babylon the great has fallen, she has fallen, she has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every unclean spirit, and a den for every unclean and hateful bird!
For all nations have drunk the wine of the fury of her fornication, the kings of the earth have given themselves up with her to fornication, and the merchants of the earth have been enriched by the abundance of her luxury. »
I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out from among her, my people, that you may not share in her sins and receive no of her plagues;
for his sins have reached heaven, and God has remembered his iniquities.
Render to her as she has rendered, and render to her double what she has done, and according to her works. In the cup she has mixed, mix double it.
As much as she has glorified herself and has been wanton, so much torment and mourning give her. For she says in her heart, "I sit as a queen, I am not a widow, and I do not want to see mourning."
Wherefore, in a single day, his plagues shall come: death, mourning, and famine; and it will be consumed by fire, for the Lord God who judged it is mighty.
The kings of the earth, who have given themselves up to fornication and who have lived in lust with her, will weep and groan for her, looking at the smoke of her conflagration.
They will stand at a distance, in fear of his torment, and they will say, "Woe, woe to the great city, to Babylon, the fortified city! For your judgment came in an hour.
The merchants of the earth weep and lament over it, for no one buys their goods any more:
goods of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, every precious wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel of very precious wood, brass, iron, and marble;
and cinnamon, incense, perfume, incense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, bodies and souls of people.
The fruits that your soul coveted have been lost to you. All the things that were delicate and sumptuous have disappeared from you, and you will no longer find them at all.
The merchants of these things, who have enriched themselves by her, will stand afar away, in fear of her torment, weeping and lamenting,
saying, "Woe, woe to the great city, which was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls!
For, in one hour, such great riches are reduced to nothing. All the captains of ships, all those who sail in any place, the sailors, and all those who earn their living on the sea, stood at a distance,
and exclaimed, looking at the smoke of its blaze, "What is like the great city?
They threw dust on their heads, and they cried out weeping and lamenting, "Woe, woe to the great city, in which all those who had their ships on the sea grew rich because of its great riches! Because in one hour, it is reduced to desolation.
"Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles and prophets, for God has judged her."
A mighty angel took a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "Thus Babylon, the great city, will be thrown down with violence, and it will be found no more.
The voices of harpists, minstrels, flute-players, and trumpeters will no longer be heard in your house. You will no longer find any craftsman, whatever his trade. The sound of a mill will no longer be heard at all in your home.
The light of a lamp will no longer shine at all in your home. The voice of husband and wife will no longer be heard in you, because your merchants were the princes of the earth, because all nations have been seduced by your magic.
In it was found the blood of the prophets and saints, and of all those who were slain on earth. »
After this, I heard something in the sky like the loud voice of a great crowd saying, Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and glory belong to our God;
for his judgments are true and just. For he judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth by her sexual immorality, and he avenged with his hand the blood of his servants. »
A second said, "Hallelujah! Its smoke rises for ever and ever. »
The twenty-four elders and the four living beings prostrated themselves and worshipped the God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen! Hallelujah! »
A voice arose from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great!"
I heard something like the voice of a great crowd, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!
Let us rejoice and be glad, and let us give him glory. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has prepared herself. »
It was given to him to clothe himself with fine, shining, and pure linen, for fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
He said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb!' He said to me, "These are the true words of God."
I threw myself at his feet to adore him. He said, "Look! Don't do that! I am a companion in servitude with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy. »
I saw the sky open, and here is a white horse. The one who rode it is called Faithful and True. He judges and fights with justice.
His eyes are a flame of fire, and there are many crowns on his head. He has written names and a written name that no one knows, except himself.
He is dressed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His name is called "the Word of God".
The armies that are in heaven, dressed in white linen, pure and fine, follow him on white horses.
From his mouth comes a sharp sword, a double-edged edge, that with it he may strike the nations. He will rule them with a rod of iron. He treads the vat of wine with the ardor of the wrath of God, the Almighty.
He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written: "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS".
I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried out in a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, "Come! Gather for the great supper of God,
in order to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of military leaders, the flesh of heroes, the flesh of horses and those who ride them, and the flesh of all men, free and slaves, small and great. »
I saw the beast, the kings of the earth and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse and his army.
The beast was taken, and with it the false prophet who performed the wonders by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
The rest were killed by the sword of the one who sat on the horse, the sword that came out of his mouth. And all the birds were satisfied with their flesh.
I saw an angel descend from heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
He seizes the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and who deceives all the inhabited earth; he bound him for a thousand years,
cast him into the abyss, shut him up and sealed him over him, so that he would not deceive the nations again until the thousand years were fulfilled. After that, he must be released for a short time.
I saw thrones, and they sat down on them, and judgment was given to them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and of those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and who had not received the mark on their foreheads and on their hands. They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
The rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years had passed. This is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy is he who has a share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.
And after the thousand years, Satan will be freed from his prison
and he will go out to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for war, whose number is like the sand of the sea.
They ascended the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. Fire came down from heaven from God and devoured them.
The devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also found. They will be tormented day and night, forever and ever.
I saw a great white throne and the one who sat on it, before whose face the earth and the sky fled. There was no room for them.
I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged according to what was written in the books, according to their works.
The sea gave up the dead that were in it. Death and hell have given back the dead that were in them. They were judged, each according to his works.
Death and hell were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
I have seen a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth are gone, and the sea is no more.
I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, come down from heaven from God, prepared like a bride who adorned herself for her husband.
I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "This is the dwelling place of God with men; he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more; there will be no more mourning, no crying, no pain. The first things have disappeared. »
He who sits on the throne says, "Behold, I am making all things new." He says, "Write, for these words of God are faithful and true."
He said to me, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will freely give to him who thirsts for the fountain of water of life.
Whoever overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.
But for the cowardly, the unbelieving, the sinners, the abominable, the murderers, the fornicators, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all the liars, their portion is in the lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. »
One of the seven angels who held the seven bowls laden with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke to me, saying, "Come hither. I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. »
He carried me in spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, which came down from heaven from God,
and who had the glory of God. Its light was like a very precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.
It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, with names written upon them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
There were three gates to the east, three gates to the north, three gates to the south, and three gates to the west.
The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
The one who spoke to me had a golden reed for a measure to measure the city, its gates and its walls.
The city is square. Its length is as great as its width. He measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand twelve stadia. Its length, breadth and height are equal.
Its wall is one hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is to say, of an angel.
The construction of its wall was made of jasper. The city was of pure gold, like pure glass.
The foundations of the city wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardony, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh hyacinth and the twelfth amethyst.
The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each of the doors was made of a pearl. The streets of the city were made of pure gold, like transparent glass.
I saw no temple there, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are his temple.
The city needs neither the sun nor the moon to shine, for the very glory of God enlightens it and his lamp is the Lamb.
The nations will walk in his light. The kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations.
Its gates will not be closed in the day, for there will be no night,
and the glory and honor of the nations will be introduced into it so that they may enter it.
There shall enter into it nothing profane, nor shall anyone who commits an abomination or a lie, but only those which are written in the Lamb's book of life.
He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, which issued from the throne of God and of the Lamb,
in the middle of its street. On this side of the river and on the other, there was the tree of life, which bore twelve kinds of fruit and bore its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were used for the healing of nations.
There will be no more curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there, and his servants will serve him.
They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
There will be no night, and they will need neither lamp nor sun, for the Lord God will enlighten them. They will reign forever and ever.
He said to me, "These words are true and true. The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to show his slaves the things that are to happen soon. »
"Behold, I am coming soon! Happy is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book! »
Now I, John, am the one who has heard and seen these things. When I heard and saw, I bowed down before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things.
He said to me, "You must not do that! I am a companion in servitude with you, with your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God. »
He said to me, "Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.
Let him who acts unjustly act unjustly again. Whoever is defiled, let him be defiled again. He who is righteous, let him still practice righteousness. He who is holy, let him still be holy. »
"Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, to give back to each according to his work.
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
Blessed are those who do his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life and enter the city through the gates.
Outside, there are dogs, enchanters, fornicators, murderers, idolaters, and all those who love and practice lying.
I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the benefit of the assemblies. I am the root and seed of David, the bright, morning star. »
The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" Let him who hears say, "Come!" Let the thirsty come. Let him who desires freely take the water of life.
I declare to all who hear the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds anything to it, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.
If anyone takes anything away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion of the tree of life and the holy city, which is written in this book.
He who bears witness to these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen! Yes, come, Lord Jesus!
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints. Amen.
